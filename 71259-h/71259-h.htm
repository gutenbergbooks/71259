  <h2 class='c005'><span class='large'>TO HIS GRACE</span><br> JOHN, DUKE OF BEDFORD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>MY LORD,</p>

<p class='c007'>If the name of your Grace had been rendered illustrious
solely by those distinguished Patriots from
whom you derived it, my pride could not fail of being
eminently gratified by being permitted to dedicate to
you the following pages: but other, and infinitely
more impressive and honourable emotions are awakened,
when I reflect, that in the present descendant of
the House of Russel are displayed that patriotic fervor,
that lofty spirit of political independence, and
that ardent zeal in the great cause of humanity, which
distinguished so many of its branches in the annals
of this great country. Indeed, my Lord, it is a felicity
to be able to attest, from experience, and now to
record, the pretensions of your Grace to the gratitude
of your country and the love of mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the wisdom of your administration was committed
a great and important, but a much neglected
portion of the United Empire. You became the ruler
of a country long oppressed, wickedly calumniated,
and still bleeding from many a wound. Soon after the
elevation of your Grace to this august situation, public
symptoms appeared which called for sagacity and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>energy of no ordinary nature. Instead of listening, in
the sunshine of vice-regal magnificence, to the vague
reports of the idle, the ignorant, or the mischievous,
you penetrated into the wild recesses of that distracted
country, reputed to contain the hot-bed of insurrection;
you personally contemplated the character of
the poor, suffering Irish peasant, in all its rough but
affecting simplicity; you beheld a fellow-being possessed
of affections easily to be won by tenderness, of
a vivid imagination, and quick and ardent susceptibility,
clothed in rags, and living in common with the
beast of the field, in a state of penury and wretchedness,
unknown to the miserable and oppressed of any
other region. To see, to feel, and to meditate relief
were all simultaneous in the mind of your Grace.
When some partial excesses at length broke out,
when the violent and the intolerant clamorously demanded
the terrible inflictions of military law, you
firmly, wisely, and most humanely resolved upon surrendering
up the guilty to the laws of their country,
without delivering over their unoffending vicinage to
the savage dominion of the bullet and the bayonet.
The noble experiment answered, and your Grace lost
no portion of your popularity, in the very spot where
dire necessity compelled you to offer up victims to
justice. Your conduct on that occasion, even in the
absence of every other laudable event of your life, is
sufficient to sweeten it to its latest period.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great and unexpected political change rendered
the administration of your Grace too brief to execute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>the enlightened and salutary plans which you had
conceived for the amelioration of Ireland; but it was
of sufficient duration to afford opportunities of displaying
those qualities of the head and of the heart,
which will endear your memory to that unhappy
country for ever, and you have left to it the benefits of
a brilliant example.</p>

<p class='c007'>That your illustrious successor may adopt the
same clemency and wisdom which your Grace so efficaciously
exhibited; and that he may complete the
measures which extraordinary political events prevented
your Grace from perfecting, is the cordial
prayer of him who is an enthusiastic well-wisher to
Ireland, and who, with great respect, has the honour
to subscribe himself,</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>I am indebted for some interesting anecdotes of
the most eminent Painters of the Dutch and Flemish
School to the authors of the Abrégé de la Vie des
Peintres, to Pilkington’s Dictionary of Painters, and
to the elegant and witty D’Israeli.</p>

<p class='c007'>I had no companion with me during the greater
part of the Tour described in the following pages,
which was taken amidst many untoward and embarrassing
circumstances, the melancholy effects of war,
and which, for that reason, will, I hope, be favoured
with the indulgent candour of my friends and of the
Public.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The public shall be my confessor.—In the summer of last
year, whilst the larger portion of the civilized world was anxiously
awaiting the result of our sincere negotiations for a peace, which,
alas! the crafty ministers of Napoleon, never intended should be
other than mere “<i><span lang="fr">romans politiques</span></i>,” the desire of contemplating
a country, and a race of people to me entirely new, induced me to
trespass upon their shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>I resolved upon visiting Holland, although in a state of reluctant
war with my own country, of a war which yet permitted to
her commerce a few stolen embraces with that of England, which
forced many a pursy Dutchman to lament the separation, and in
the narcotic atmosphere of his consoling pipe, to wish for better
times. In gratifying my wishes, I was guilty of assuming a character
respected in every country, as well for its being most wisely
and profitably at peace with all the world, as for its integrity and
enterprize: I became an American, and by an act of temporary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>adoption, fixed upon Baltimore in North America as the place of
my nativity. A fortunate correspondence in the personal description,
except a slight variation, not easily discoverable, relating to
my face and age, enabled a friend of mine, a <em>legitimate American</em>,
to accommodate me with his passport, which after all I might as
well have left behind me, so kindly are the Hollanders disposed
towards us.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was promised by my friend a full description of the principal
places in Baltimore, and of the adjacent country, that I might pass
unsuspected through a cross examination, should any be attempted:
the description never arrived, or arrived too late, and I ascended
my chaise, as ignorant of Baltimore as of the Peruvian
Potosi, trusting to that good <em>chance</em> which has often favoured me,
and under the guidance of which</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In my school days, when I had lost one shaft,</div>
      <div class='line'>I shot his fellow of the self same flight</div>
      <div class='line'>The self same way, with more advised watch,</div>
      <div class='line'>To find the other forth; by vent’ring both,</div>
      <div class='line'>I oft found both.”</div>
      <div class='line in32'><cite>Merchant of Venice</cite>, Act I. Sc. 1.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The stratagem, if not perfectly blameless, was at least intended
to be an inoffensive one; I had no hopes of a peace, and consequently
none of seeing Holland in a more regular mode. I went
not to investigate the nakedness of the land, and by availing myself
of its confidence to penetrate the military depots, the docks
and arsenals of a country not in amity with my own.</p>

<p class='c007'>I abhor the character of a spy, moving in friendly garb, however
useful his treachery may be to his employers. My imposition
extended no farther than to enable me to make a picturesque tour
through an almost aqueous kingdom, to view its natives in their
ordinary habits, to glide upon their liquid roads, to saunter in their
green avenues and flourishing gardens, and trace the wonderful
results of that daring and indefatigable ingenuity, which has raised
the permanent habitation of man in the ocean, and made successful
inroads upon the physical order of the universe.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>But though the deception gave no pang to my conscience, yet,
harmless as it was, (and let me mention it as a moral lesson) it
did not escape the lash of many a petty inconvenience. Often have
I been pestered upon the supposition of my being an American
merchant, with interrogations as to the number of partners I had,
how many clerks I kept, and the many other perplexing queries
of minds at once devoted to commerce, and curiosity: nor did I
escape dilemmas infinitely more perilous.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having thus in all candour confessed my offence, if such it
ought in justice to be called, and which has also met with its due
proportion of chastisement, I trust I shall receive absolution from
my reader, and in that hope I shall now proceed to my narrative.</p>

<p class='c007'>I intended to have availed myself, as I wish I had done on
former occasions, of the indulgence usually allowed to tours given
in the shape of epistolary correspondence, the ease and familiarity
of which render the tourist less formal, and the critic more indulgent;
but the war presented an obstacle to the adoption of a plan
which would have been more congenial to my mind, and to the
nature of the remarks I have to offer.</p>

<p class='c007'>In company with two highly esteemed friends, I proceeded to
Gravesend: upon the road, we were charmed, by occasional views
of the majestic Thames, formed by a rich setting sun into the
appearance of an inverted sky, decorated by ships more supported
<em>over</em> than <em>upon</em> its bosom, and a vast expanse of richly cultivated
land fading in the mist of a far distant horizon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the country which I was quitting, and of that to which I
was proceeding, our Charles the Second, a monarch of whom Sir
Richard Bulstrode justly says, that had he loved business as well
as he understood it, he would have been the greatest prince in
Europe, observed, “that the former was the most comfortable
climate to live under, he had ever experienced; as there were
more days in the year, and more hours in the day, that a man
could take exercise out of doors in it, than in any country he had
ever known. That during his exile he had seen many countries,
of which none pleased him so much as the Flemings, who were
the most honest and true-hearted people he had ever met with;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>and added very prophetically to me, to whom he addressed
these remarks, I am weary of travelling, I am resolved to go
abroad no more; but when I am dead and gone, I know not
what my brother will do, I am much afraid that when he comes
to the throne he will be <em>obliged to travel again</em>.” A prediction
fatally realized by the wicked folly of the royal object of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Gravesend we paid six guineas apiece to a Dutch captain,
and a little favourable breeze springing up, we proceeded on
board with a large party composed of specimens of the human
race from various parts of the globe, proceeding, through the indulgence
of the government of Holland, to their various destinations
on the continent. The moment we stepped on board we
found we were victims to the most infamous imposition. Six
guineas for a berth in a vessel, which Noah in the first rudiments
of his art, would have made a thousand times more commodious!
Figure to yourself about forty persons stowed in a Dutch galliot
of about one hundred tons burthen, deeply laden with a cargo of
chalk, &#38;c. a hold near the bows covered with straw for the accommodation
of thirty-six of the passengers; a low miserable cabin,
four feet high on the deck, which formed the honey-moon bower
of a young Swiss and a pretty English girl just married; and
a little hole astern which, furnished with a couple of tickings
crammed with Dutch peas instead of feathers, constituted the
vestibule, drawing-room and chamber for me and one of my companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hoping for a speedy termination to our marine miseries, we
set sail and slowly creeped down the Thames by the aid of a
scanty breeze, which dying before we had advanced two miles,
left us as a legacy to the tardy tides. Indeed, we almost <em>tided</em> it
over to Holland, in the achievement of which we were six long
days and nights; but then the days were serene and warm, and
the nights were adorned by a brilliant moon, and the blue vault
of heaven was spangled over with stars.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our captain and his crew exhibited twice a day that attention
to their devotions, which is still so characteristic of their country,
in spite of every hostile attack and insidious intrigue of France, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>the most vulgar, impious, and savage era of her bloody revolution.
The breakfast of every morning, and the supper of every evening,
were consecrated by a long shrill anthem, and still longer prayer.
The cook was the chaplain, and the kitchen, a hole of about eight
feet by five, the chapel. The spirit of Calvin, if it be not offered
up to the manes of Servetus, must have smiled with satisfaction
at the motley group, surrounding a pot of boiled peas and pork,
and enveloped in a deep fog of steam and smoke, thus offering up
their homage in the language, and according to the rites of that
merciless reformer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The piety of the commander was carried to an extreme
length. One morning we were disturbed by a great noise: the
captain had compelled his son, a sprightly lad of about nine years
old, to read the Dutch Testament for three days together, and
with scarcely any cessation; in consequence of which the young
disciple became restive, and whilst his father’s back was turned
committed the apostles to the deep, for which he received a tolerable
proportion of castigation. Fifty times a day were we annoyed
by our pious commander vociferating to his child,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="nl">Leer, leer, jou luigaart, of dit endje touw zal je leeren.</span>”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Learn, learn, you idler, or this rope’s end shall teach you.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I restored our captain, who spoke English very well, to good
humour, by relating to him an anecdote of the activity and cool
philosophy of a Dutch sailor belonging to the fleet under the command
of the celebrated Van Tromp, who immortalized himself by
his naval victories over the Spaniards in 1639, but submitted to
the superior skill and prowess of the British fleet under the command
of the sturdy patriotic Blake. At the time when the hostile
fleets were laying very near each other, after a severe engagement,
to refit, a British and Dutch sailor endeavoured to rival each
other by their activity in ascending and descending the rigging of
their respective ships; at last the English sailor astonished his
competitor by standing with his heels in the air upon the truck
head of the main top gallant mast; the Dutchman endeavoured to
do the same, but in the attempt fell upon the deck, from which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>with great anguish and difficulty, he raised himself a little, and
exclaiming to the Englishman, “dere mynheer can you do dat,”
expired upon the spot. The Dutch are very fond of dogs. Our
captain had a bitch and two puppies on board of a very peculiar
breed, for which he expressed great attachment, and he was one
day not a little amused at my telling him that at the commencement
of the gallant action which took place between the Nymph
and Cleopatra in the last war, there was a large Newfoundland
dog on board the former vessel, which, as soon as the firing began,
ran from below deck in spite of every exertion of the men to keep
him down, and climbing up into the main chains, there kept up a
continual barking, and exhibited the most violent rage during the
whole of the engagement. When the Cleopatra struck he was
amongst the foremost to board her, and walked up and down her
decks as if he participated in the glory of the victory obtained by
the English.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a passage, during which our patience was put to a severe
trial, we discovered Schouwen, and soon after the Island of Goree,
where the wind began to freshen, and just before we made
the mouth of the Maas, we met and hailed a fine large fishing
smack, the captain of which our commander endeavoured to prevail
upon, by the usual and generally successful application of a
little money, to smuggle us into the Briel: after a long consultation,
the captain and crew of the smack, not considering that all
was fish which came to their net, refused to take charge of us, and
to our no very pleasant sensations, instead of standing out to sea,
tacked and returned to the Briel under full press of canvass. A
low slimy shore surmounted by green flags and a few scanty
oziers announced our voyage to be at its close, and we entered
the river of a country which our Hudibrastic Butler thus peevishly
describes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A country that draws fifty foot of water,</div>
      <div class='line'>“In which men live as in the hold of nature;</div>
      <div class='line'>“And when the sea does in upon them break,</div>
      <div class='line'>“And drowns a province, does but spring a leak;</div>
      <div class='line'>“That always ply the pump, and never think</div>
      <div class='line'>“They can be safe, but at the rate they stink;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>That live as if they had been run aground,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, when they die, are cast away and drown’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>That dwell in ships, like swarms of rats, and prey</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the goods all nations’ ships convey;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when their merchants are blown up and crack</div>
      <div class='line'>Whole towns are cast away in storms and wreck;</div>
      <div class='line'>That feed like cannibals, on other fishes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And serve their cousin germans up in dishes,</div>
      <div class='line'>A land that rides at anchor, and is moor’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>In which they do not live, but go aboard.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Duke of Alva, with more whimsicality and less bitterness,
observed, “that the Dutch were the nearest neighbours to hell of
any people on the earth, for they dwelt the lowest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of the tide being always very rapid when going
out, and the wind again falling, we came to an anchor in the mouth
of the Maas. One of the first objects that saluted our eyes, in this
state, was the telegraph, which was in a state of uncommon activity,
and the glasses of its official attendants often came in direct opposition
with ours. The balls flew up and down with wonderful rapidity
for nearly an hour after we anchored, and sufficiently explained
the motive which induced the captain of the smack to return to
port. The signification of the word Briel, in Dutch, is <em>spectacle</em>,
which is supposed to have given its name to this place, on account
of the extensive view which its buildings command of the surrounding
country. This town is celebrated for having given birth to the
illustrious warrior I before mentioned, admiral Cornelius Van
Tromp.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the dead of the night, and in a deep fog, a fishing boat dropped
along side, the master of which told us that the last vessel
which had arrived from England had been confiscated, and all the
passengers made prisoners, and after this exordium offered to conduct
us in safety past the guard-ship if we would give him two
guineas apiece: and to secure our transit, he proposed shutting us
all down in his cabin, under hatchways, for that night and the whole
of the next day, and then dropping past the guard-ship in the evening;
during all which time we must have sat chin to knee, and have
been infinitely worse accommodated than a cargo of African slaves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>As we had an aversion from being introduced into the kingdom in
this furtive manner, we persisted in refusing to quit our vessel, to
the no little mortification of our captain, who having safely deposited
our passage money in a large tin box, was very anxious to get
rid of us in any manner. I believe personal apprehensions induced
him to weigh the anchor early next morning, and to bear away for
Maaslandsleys, on the other side of the Maas, where after the captain
had satisfied the commodore commanding the guard-ships
there, to whom he was well known, that we all came from Varel,
a little neutral town to the eastward of the Weser, a fast sailing
fishing boat was provided to take us up to Rotterdam, a distance of
twenty-five miles, at half a guinea a head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gladly we bade adieu to our miserable ark, and about six o’clock
in the evening embarked upon the Merwe river, a noble branch of
the Maas, the breadth of which is about a mile, lessening but in a
little degree as it reaches Rotterdam. The water of this river is
rather foul, its shores are beautifully lined with villages, farm houses
and avenues of trees. A botanical gentleman informed me that the
eryngium campestre, field eryngo, so very rare in England, grows
in great profusion, and wild, on either side of the river, and in most
other parts of Holland.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the night advanced, the floating lanterns of the fishermen
had a pleasing and romantic effect, as we glided along with
a fine breeze; and a row of lamps running parallel with a canal
supplied by the Merwe, announced our passing Schiedam, so
celebrated throughout Holland for its distilleries of geneva, of
which we were informed there were three hundred before the
Dutch submitted to the arms of France.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the French troops entered Holland as victors, this beautiful
river, in a season remarkably rigorous, formed a compact
road of ice for the infantry, cavalry, and artillery, of the invaders:
dreadful as the winter was, the French were in want of the most
necessary articles of clothing; even whole battalions were destitute
of shoes and stockings, and centinels frequently did duty with
no other covering than a tattered blanket, and the fragment of a
pair of breeches, which time and service had reduced by instalments
to little more than a few shreds: yet they did not repine.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>In a milder climate, after the French took possession of
Bologna, a soldier, whose coat was nearly in the predicament of
his military countryman’s breeches before mentioned, came up to
Bonaparte, and begged that he would order him a new one, to
which his general, who had none to give him, very shrewdly
replied, “my good fellow, that will not do, it will hinder your
wounds from being seen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the French troops entered Rotterdam, they were quartered
on the inhabitants, whose good opinion, I was well informed,
they soon conciliated by their quiet conduct and orderly deportment.
I afterwards received the same character of the French troops
in other parts of Holland, from those with whom, I am convinced,
they were not very welcome visitors, on account of the contributions
which they levied.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the faces of our crew, and the scenery on each side of us,
before dusk-fall, we saw those studies to which the exquisite
works of the Dutch school have familiarized every person of taste.
About twelve o’clock we arrived at the boom, or barrier for shipping
at Rotterdam, and here a luckless accident had nearly befallen
me. The luggage of the passengers was deposited in small
holds nearly the length of the vessel, covered over with loose
boards: the night was dark, and as by the light of a solitary lamp
we were endeavouring to get at our luggage, a fat Dutchman’s
wife sprung out of the cabin, in which she had been concealed
during our expedition up the river, who thinking that we were
molesting some of her bonnet boxes, in the unguarded violence
of her approach, slipped into one of the holds, the boards of which
had been inadvertently left open by the Swiss bridegroom before
mentioned, in an irritable struggle to obtain his luggage; the oaths
and howlings of the poor lady brought out her husband, a man
whom we had remarked for the unpleasantness of his physiognomy
and deportment during the voyage, and as I stood nearest to his
prostrate wife in the act of assisting her, he charged me with
having maliciously occasioned her suffering, and threatened
repeatedly to call the watchmen of the city and send me and my
companions to prison.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>It was a long time before I could allay the storm, and dulcify
the temper of this man, which, considering my situation, required
some little forbearance and management of feeling. At length we
got on shore, and after much difficulty and perambulation discovered
a comfortable hotel in the suburbs; the gates of the city
being always shut, and the boom closed at eleven o’clock.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our hotel lay at the bottom of a most beautiful avenue of trees,
running parallel with the river opposite to the ferry. Our landlord
was very civil, and all his servants spoke French. In the principal
apartment was a print of Napoleon in his coronation robes: I afterwards
observed similiar prints in many other houses in the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of the principal merchants of Rotterdam have country-houses
in these delightful suburbs. I walked along a line of them,
and beheld for the first time a specimen of the taste of the Dutch
in rural scenery: the gardens, upon a level with the river, and
divided from it by a high raised road, appeared to have been all
designed by a mathematician; but still their neatness and luxuriance
left a pleasing impression on the mind. Upon every gate, or
house, a motto indicative of the mind of the owner, or of the character
of the place, presented itself, of which the following are
specimens:</p>

<p class='c014'><span lang="nl">Vreede is myn Lust Haf</span></p>

<p class='c014'>Peace is my garden.</p>

<p class='c014'><span lang="nl">Lust en rust</span></p>

<p class='c014'>Hope and repose.</p>

<p class='c014'><span lang="nl">Na by Bruten</span></p>

<p class='c014'>Almost out of town.</p>

<p class='c014'><span lang="nl">Ziet op u minder</span></p>

<p class='c014'>Look upon those beneath you.</p>

<p class='c014'>N. B. This was inscribed upon a
large house that commanded
some little cottages.</p>

<p class='c014'><span lang="nl">Wel te vreeda</span></p>

<p class='c014'>Very content, &#38;c. &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>These inscriptions are seldom used but by opulent tradesmen;
amongst the higher classes they are considered to be a little tinctured
with vulgarity, though, as I found, they sometimes indulge
in them: the villas of the latter are frequently known by names
corresponding with those which are applied to the country residences
of the superior families in England.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the morning our luggage was inspected by the proper
officers, who gave us very little trouble, and were content with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>trifling douceur. The entrance to the city, towards the river,
through the principal gate, called De Nieuwe Hoofds Poort, a
structure infinitely more elegant than another barrier of this city,
called De Oude Hoofds Poort, is very handsome.</p>

<p class='c007'>The immediate transition from the tranquillity of the country
to the busy hum of men was very striking: the canals, with their
numerous draw-bridges, as we proceeded to our city hotel, the
Mareschal de Turenne, were lined with vessels of all sorts and
sizes; and notwithstanding the war, every one appeared to be engaged
in some active pursuit or another.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before hostilities began, it was no uncommon circumstance to
see between three and four hundred merchant ships, from England
alone, lying in these canals and in the Maas; by which a
vast commerce is carried on with the greatest facility and economy,
from the centre to the extremities of the kingdom; and as
they communicate with the Rhine and other large rivers, all the
productions of the earth are conveyed at little expense to many
parts of the continent, in a period of tranquillity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of beautiful streets adorned, as is the case throughout
Holland, with noble rows of trees, is a spectacle at once novel
and beautiful. The trees act as a fan to the houses in hot weather,
and their leaves are said to inhale whatever mephitic air may arise
from such of the canals as are stagnant, and to breathe it out again
with refreshing purity.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a sick chamber, fresh flowers are <em>now</em> thought salubrious,
although, in no very distant time, they were regarded by the faculty
as extremely noxious.</p>

<p class='c007'>The city derives its name from the adjoining river Rotte,
which unites with the Merwe, and from the neighbourhood of
both to the sea, renders the situation of this town very eligible for
trade, commerce, and navigation. The pleasure-boats of some of
the merchants, which we saw moored opposite to their houses, appeared
to be very clumsy, and constructed only for smoking or napping
in: they were broad, high at the head and stern, admitted
only of one rower, and had a heavy cabin with moveable glass
windows towards the stern.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>One of the first appearances which impress a foreigner on
his arrival in Holland is that of the houses, which, built of very
small bricks, very lofty, and filled with large windows, lean forward
as they ascend; to such a rage has this unaccountable passion for
avoiding an upright been carried, that I am sure many of them
must be two or three yards out of the perpendicular: nothing can
be more whimsical than the corner houses of most of the streets.
If these houses had not the appearance of being perfectly stable,
from the freshness of their outsides, and from their presenting no
fissures, a stranger would be induced from apprehension of personal
safety, to prefer paddling his way in the very centre of their
canals, to walking in the streets. No scene can at first be more
novel and interesting than that which Rotterdam presents; masts
of ships, enlivened by gay streamers; beautiful stately trees and
lofty leaning houses appear mingled together, and at one view he
sees before him the characteristic features of the country, the
city, and the sea.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>One of the first places we visited was the Boom-quay, or
Boompies, which extends along the river, about half a mile from
the new to the old head, the two places where the water enters the
city, and fills the canals, which are seven in number: this street
is very broad and truly magnificent; and the prospect from it,
over the river, and the opposite country, highly delightful. Cheyney-walk
at Chelsea is a very humble resemblance to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of the houses are very noble, and some of them are
built of free-stone, which not being the produce of the country,
must have been brought to the spot at a great expense. In England
a rage for expensive building had so possessed a man whom
I knew, and who resided very far from the capital, that he had
many parcels filled with bricks and stones sent down to his workmen
by the mail coach.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Boom-quay forms a fine mall for the inhabitants of the
city, and is chiefly the residence of the most opulent and elegant
families. An English nobleman, Lord North and Gray, had
many years since a superb house here, which he became entitled
to in right of his wife, a rich Dutch lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon this quay once resided the celebrated Bayle, the author
of the Historical and Critical Dictionary, and professor of philosophy
and history at Rotterdam, from which he was removed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the influence of M. Jurieu, who in a violent controversy with him,
had illiberally misrepresented his principles, and driven him to
great penury. The writings of this extraordinary man are so versatile
and so adapted to every one’s taste, that he secured readers
amongst divines, philosophers, physicians, wits, and libertines in
every part of Europe. Saurin, with that antithesis for which he
was more known than for the elegance of his compositions, thus
describes him: “Bayle was one of those extraordinary men, whom
it is difficult to reconcile with themselves, and whose opposite
qualities give us room to doubt whether we ought to consider him
as the best, or the worst of men. On the one hand he was a great
philosopher, who knew how to distinguish truth from falsehood,
who could at one view perceive all the consequences of a principle,
and the chain or series, in which they were linked together; on
the other, he was a great sophist, who undertook to confound
truth with falsehood, and knew how to deduce false inferences
from the hypothesis he advanced. On the one hand, he was a man
of learning and of knowledge, who had read all that could be read,
and remembered all that could be remembered; on the other, he
was ignorant, or affected to be so, of the most common things, in
respect of which he proposed such difficulties, as had been answered
a thousand times. On the one hand he attacked the most
eminent men, opened a large field of labour for them, led them
through the most difficult ways, and if he did not get the better of
them, at least gave them great trouble, to get the better of him;
on the other, he made use of the worst of authors, to whom he
was lavish of his praise, frequently disgracing his writings by
citing such names as no learned man ever mentioned.” So speaks
Saurin of this able man, whose abilities, however, have been honoured
with the usual homage; they have been allowed to consecrate
the place in which they flourished. No stranger can visit the
Boom-quay without being informed that Bayle resided there, and
without having the spot where his little mansion stood pointed out
to him. It is the noble nature of genius to requite the ingratitude
of a thankless country, by shedding upon it unquenchable lustre,
and raising it in the rank of nations.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>In several parts of the city, memorials of the inroads of the
Spaniards are traceable, not only in the forms of several of the
buildings, but in several mottos and inscriptions in their language,
which are still legible in many of the old buildings, in this and in
other cities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of Jews in Rotterdam is very great, and many of
them are of high respectability, and as much distinguished for their
integrity, as their industry and opulence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after my arrival I had the pleasure of dining with one of
the first families of that persuasion: our host, a very amiable man,
gave us a true Dutch dinner, consisting of nearly fifteen different
sorts of fish, exquisitely dressed, and served up with vegetables of
various kinds. In Holland, in preparing the fish for the kettle, the
head, fins, and tail, are generally cut off. In this city port wine is
scarcely ever drank; it is by no means gratifying to a Dutch palate.
Some was presented to me at a dinner where I was, but it
was so old that all its flavour had evaporated. The principal wines
drank are Claret, Madeira, and the Rhine wines. I found the bread
in Holland every where excellent, and the coffee every where bad.</p>

<p class='c007'>I soon found that the received opinion of there being no beggars
in Holland is perfectly erroneous. I was frequently beset by these
sons and daughters of sorrow or idleness, who preferred their petition
with indefatigable pursuit, but in so gentle a tone, that it was
evident they were fearful of the police. They are abundant, but orderly.
It was observed by some English in Holland, that a Dutch
beggar is too wise to waste his breath by asking alms of a Dutchman,
and that relief is only sought from strangers: the fact is,
there are so many asylums for paupers, that a Dutchman acquainted
with the legislative provision made for them, always considers
a beggar as a lawless vagabond.</p>

<p class='c007'>For this reason, and this alone, Charity seldom takes an airing
in Holland: towards the wretched, in the streets, the rich in this
country</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>In no country of its size, as will appear in the course of this
journal, are there more charitable institutions, and at the same time
a stronger appetite for accumulation. To make a good bargain is
considered by many a Dutchman as the highest achievement of the
human mind. As a proof that they never suffer their national
animosities to interfere with individual interest, the reader may
rely on the following anecdote.</p>

<p class='c007'>In an early stage of the last war, when the Dutch government
rigorously prohibited the importation of English manufactures,
some members of the executive body entered into an agreement
with a mercantile house in Rotterdam, to supply the requisition
for the clothing of the French army, by a clandestine importation
of cloth from England, and the looms of Yorkshire accordingly
clothed ten thousand French soldiers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same commercial spirit was observed by the Dutch many
years since to us, when, in a severe battle between the fleets of
the Republic and Great Britain, during a cessation of the fight,
for the mutual accommodation of repairing the damages sustained,
some of the officers of the Dutch ships actually offered the
captains of some of ours, supplies of gunpowder at an advanced
price, in consequence of understanding that two or three of our
ships had nearly exhausted their stores of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Dey of Tunis made a more whimsical offer; when the
heroic and immortal Nelson threatened to blow his capital about
his ears, the Dey sent to his lordship to know the cost of every
shot that would be fired, the answer was nearly a pound sterling;
upon which the Dey said, if his lordship would calculate how
many shots would be necessary to demolish his capital, and send
him half the amount in good bills, he would destroy it himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>I nowhere saw, except amongst the skippers, that mighty
mass of breeches, in which my expectation had in part clothed
every Dutchman’s frame: but the appearance of many of the men
in long flowered waistcoats, and trunk hose, and the females in
short plaited petticoats, blue stockings, and large round silver
buckles projecting over either side of the foot, was very whimsical.
Many of their dresses are hereditary; and grandfather,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>father, and son, have in regular succession proceeded to the altar
in the same nuptial breeches. The quays of Rotterdam are very
spacious, and every where embellished with trees; and the canals
deeper and cleaner than in any other of the large cities in the
kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of the features of every street being so similar,
a stranger finds uncommon difficulty in reaching the place of his
destination, or in returning to his hotel, without a guide.</p>

<p class='c007'>After having secured a bedroom and deposited our luggage at
the Mareschal de Turenne, kept by Mr. Crabb, an Englishman,
who renders the character of a maitre d’hotel eminently respectable,
by his attention to foreigners of every description, and to his
own countrymen in particular, by moderate charges and excellent
accommodations, we proceeded to the Exchange at two o’clock,
when the merchants assemble.</p>

<p class='c007'>This building is an oblong square with a covered walk on each
side, and is plain and handsome. It was finished in 1736. I was
astonished to find it crowded in every part, and presenting, in the
activity and bustle which were displayed, every appearance of a
great commercial country in a high state of prosperous tranquillity.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this Babel assembly the greatest interest for a successful
termination of the negotiation between France and England seemed
anxiously to prevail; and induced a stranger like myself to think
that the interests of Holland were pretty closely interwoven with
those of England.</p>

<p class='c007'>The arrival of English papers, and of couriers from Paris, never
failed to excite a strong sensation from one end of the city to the
other. Upon the exchange I saw several Englishmen transacting
business; and such is the respect which the Dutch bear towards
us, that we soon found the suspicion of our being English rather
increased than damped the civilities we experienced.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Rotterdam may be considered, as Bonaparte has recently
described the city of Hamburg, <i><span lang="fr">une ville Anglaise</span></i>, in consequence
of so many English families having settled there before the revolution,
and also of the proximity of its port to England, it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>with surprise I found that the new ruler and form of government
were so popular as they are in this city.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the years 1794 and 1795 the progress of the French arms
excited uncommon consternation in this city, in which a higher
veneration for the stadtholderian government, as established under
the influence of England and Prussia in 1787, existed, than in any
other city in the United Provinces.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the French advanced, the principal English families fled
with great precipitation, and were followed by many of the Dutch:
their flight was in the most inclement part of a winter remarkably
rigorous, and they were obliged to pass over frozen canals, rivers
and deep snows, many by the most wretched open conveyances,
in their way to Helvoetsluys, where they embarked for that country,
which, since the time of the first Charles, has, thank Heaven!
been neither the seat of war, nor of revolutionary phrenzy.</p>

<p class='c007'>A short time before we visited Rotterdam, we heard that the
king and queen had visited that city, the only one which they had
then honoured with their presence, except the seat of the royal
residence at the Hague.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon their arrival in the city, their majesties and the two
princes, in their carriages, attended by their suite and an escort of
horse, proceeded to the Exchange, where they were waited upon
by the principal functionaries and a deputation of the most opulent
merchants of the city. Their majesties appeared to be much
affected by the very flattering manner in which they were received.</p>

<p class='c007'>The queen, who is always mentioned by those who have had
the honour of knowing her before and since the wonderful elevation
of so many branches of her family, as a most amiable, enlightened,
and accomplished woman, very much gratified some of
the members, and the nation at large, by observing upon the Exchange:
“We are deeply penetrated by the cordiality with which
we have been received in the country; as strangers we could not,
and did not expect such a reception; but we hope to remain long
enough amongst you to secure your esteem, by doing all the good
in our power.” This short address, delivered with that grace and
manner, which, I am informed, are so characteristic of her majesty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>captivated all the Dutchmen present, and spread with great
celerity through every part of the city, and contributed to raise
her very high in the public estimation.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the Exchange their majesties proceeded to the Admiralty,
and were gratified, for the first time in their lives, with
seeing a man of war, a seventy-four, launched; and after partaking
of a splendid collation, they passed through the principal streets
in a single carriage, unattended by their body-guard. On this
public occasion, the only external ornament which the king wore
was the star of the legion of honour.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the department of the admiralty, the king has effected
many wise and salutary regulations. He has abolished all the
sinecure offices attached to it, reduced overgrown salaries, and
doubled the hours of labour of the clerks, who were before almost
receiving the wages of idleness from the country. By this firm
and sagacious conduct, the king has already produced a saving to
the state of <em>two millions sterling a year</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the new constitution, which will be given hereafter,
was finally adjusted, the king declared, that the national debt
should be most sacredly respected, and its guarantee forms accordingly
a permanent feature in that system, and measures have
been adopted for its speedy liquidation. The king has also chosen
two gentlemen of high respectability from the body of the merchants
of Rotterdam to be members of his council.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before these circumstances, and the previous unsettled condition
of the country are known or reflected upon, it would appear
somewhat paradoxical, that as the interests of the Dutch have a
bias in favour of England, and as their government is of French
construction, the ruler who has been placed over them by events
little less than miraculous, could ever, and especially in so short
a time, have made himself popular; but to the fact I pledge myself,
upon the authority of some of the most respectable and
enlightened Dutchmen in different parts of Holland, repeatedly
renewed to me.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a subject of congratulation with every Englishman, that a
similar spirit of economy and retrenchment animates the minds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of the present administration, which, during the short period of
its elevation to power, has purified many of the public offices of
slothful supernumeraries, and has to its eternal honour refused to
augment the public burthens by reversionary pensions.</p>

<p class='c007'>By such instances of public virtue, and the wisdom, vigour,
and sound policy, which reign in the councils of his majesty, the
British empire may ultimately triumph over its enemies, or at
least be preserved entire amidst the general wreck of other nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of Holland was described to me to resemble his
brother Napoleon, very strongly in size, complexion, manner,
thoughtful taciturnity, and abstemiousness: he is a great invalid,
and has received some severe paralytic shocks in one of his arms,
for which, as well as for the general extreme delicate state of his
health, he has been obliged to visit the baths of Wisbaden, and to
drink the waters of the Spa; which prevented his remaining in
Holland but for a very short time, after the constitution had placed
him on the throne, and he was absent when I was there.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king has the reputation of being much pleased with the
English character, and very fond of the society of Englishmen; a
gratification which a series of adverse circumstances has prevented
him from indulging in for some time past. I remember, when
I was at Paris, during the brief pause of war, that just gave “a
time for frighted peace to pant,” he was never more happy than
when he had one of our countrymen at his splendid and hospitable
table.</p>

<p class='c007'>The queen is, as she was also described to me, a brunette of
considerable beauty, inclined to the <i><span lang="fr">en bon point</span></i>, has a face expressive
of great suavity of mind, and is highly accomplished; she
particularly excels in dancing, in which, for the gracefulness of
her attitudes, she is said to be unrivalled. To this elegant accomplishment
she is particularly attached, and when she travels, is
generally complimented, in any considerable town where she stops
for a day or two, with a public ball, an attention by which she is
always much gratified.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their majesties have two princes who are very young; the
eldest is called Napoleon after the emperor. Should the dynasty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>of the Bonapartes experience no convulsive overthrow, it is generally
believed that, upon the demise of that extraordinary being,
who has pushed so many kings from their thrones to make room for
the members of his own family, the crown of France will devolve
upon this child.</p>

<p class='c007'>In detailing these few anecdotes, which to me at least were
interesting, I have been induced by a veneration for truth alone, to
give a representation which, to such as think that nothing favourable,
however deserved, should be reported of those with whom we
are not in amity, will not be very palatable. To an enemy, if not
generous, let us at least be always just. It is as base in principle,
as it is dangerous in politics, to depreciate the popularity of a
prince with whom we are at war, for it obviously leads to a miscalculation
of his influence upon his people, and of the nature and
extent of his strength and resources.</p>

<p class='c007'>I abhor fuming a sovereign with adulation, more especially
the ruler of a country at war with my own; but it is what I owe
to my own country to relate the fact.</p>

<p class='c008'>In my way to the celebrated statue of Erasmus, and indeed
wherever I moved, almost every face I met looked as if it belonged
to a soul more disposed to cultivate the figures of arithmetic,
than of rhetoric. I saw none of those sprightly physiognomies,
which abound in the large towns of England or France, full of
smiles, of levity, and carelessness, the happy owners of which appear
as if they basked and frolicked in the sunshine of every event.
Even the Spanish proverb, “thoughts close, looks loose,” is not
observed in this city. An eye prone to the earth, a look of settled
meditation, and a measured pace denote the Rotterdammer. Yet
with these appearances Holland has not been insensible to that
literary merit, in honour of which, in other times and regions, the
Grecians and Romans raised temples, statues, and constituted
public games, to which the Persians, the Arabians, the Turks, and
even the Chinese, presented the most magnificent rewards.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the inhabitants of Languedoc established floral games, at
which they bestowed golden flowers as prizes to the fortunate
poets; as Rome crowned Petrarch with laurel; as Ravenna erected
a marble tomb to the memory of Dante, and Certaldo a statue to
Boccaccio; as delighted princesses touched with their fragrant
lips the cheeks of poets; as the Venetians paid to Sannazarius six
hundred pistoles for six verses; as Baif received a silver image of
Minerva from his native city, and Ronsard had apartments reserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>for him in the palace of Charles IX. of France, and also the
honour of receiving poetical epistles from that monarch: behold the
Hollander has raised a superb bronze figure to the memory of
that great restorer of the Latin tongue, Erasmus.</p>

<p class='c007'>This statue stands upon an arch crossing a canal, and is nearly
ten feet high; it was finished in 1622, and is said to be the
<i><span lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</span></i> of Henry de Keiser, a very celebrated statuary and
architect. It has been observed, that in the quality of the different
statues which the Dutch raised to the memory of Erasmus, may
be traced the different degrees of zeal with which his memory
was cherished by them.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1540 they raised a statue of wood; seventeen years afterwards,
blushing for the little respect they had observed, they exchanged
it for one of blue stone; and in sixty-five years following
apotheosized him by the noble memorial of their veneration, which
I contemplated with equal admiration and delight. In 1572 the
Spaniards, Vandal-like, shot at the stone statue with their muskets,
and threw it in the canal, from whence it was afterwards raised
and again set up, by order of the magistrates, upon the expulsion
of the Spaniards; upon whom the Dutch retaliated in the most
spirited and gallant manner, by attacking that nation through her
colonial establishments in the East and West Indies, and in Africa,
and by capturing the rich galleons of their merciless invaders.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bronze figure is clad in an ecclesiastical habit, with an open
book in his hand. Various attempts have at different times been
made to convert the sage into a turncoat: before the revolution
which expelled the stadtholder and his family, every concavity in
his dress was crammed, on certain holidays, with oranges; during
the hey-day of the republican form of government, amidst the celebration
of its festivals, he was covered with tri-coloured ribbons,
when the juice of the orange was never suffered to pass the lips of
a true patriot!! Even the marigold, first consecrated by poets to
the Virgin, and afterwards used as a symbol of the House of
Orange,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The marigold, whose courtier’s face</div>
      <div class='line'>Echoes the sun, and doth unlace</div>
      <div class='line'>Her at his rise,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>was expelled from the gardens of the new republicans. Oh, Liberty!
happy had it been for millions, if all the outrages perpetrated
in thy hallowed name had spent themselves upon ribbons, oranges,
and marigolds!</p>

<p class='c007'>Oudaan the poet has done honour to this star of erudition, whose
works filled ten folio volumes, and whose talents had nearly raised
him to cardinalate under Pope Paul III. in the following lines in
Dutch, which are inscribed on his pedestal:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The reader may perhaps be pleased with the following anecdote.
When Erasmus was in England, which he visited several
times, and where he was honoured with the friendship of Archbishop
Warham, Bishops Tonstal and Fox, Dean Colet, Lord
Montjoy, Sir Thomas More, and other distinguished men, he
mentions a custom then prevalent amongst the females of this
country, the discontinuance of which, considering how much improved
they are since the time of Erasmus, and how their natural
charms are heightened by the grace of the Grecian drapery, must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>be a subject of infinite regret with all who love and cherish the
sex, as it ought to be loved and cherished.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>ERASMUS.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Sunt hic in Anglia nymphæ divinis vultibus, blandæ, faciles. Est præterea
mos nunquam satis laudandis, sive quò venias, omnium osculis receperis,
sive discedas aliquo, osculis dimitteris. Redis redduntur suavia;
venitur ad te propinantur suavia, disceditur abs te, dividuntur basia; occurritur
alicui, basiatur affatim; denique quocumque te moveas, suaviorum
plena sunt omnia.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The women in England are divinely beautiful, affable, and good humoured.
There is a custom also here, which can never be sufficiently
commended. When you go any where, you are received by all with
<em>kisses</em>; when you depart, you are dismissed with <em>kisses</em>. On your return,
<em>kisses</em> are again bestowed on you. When they visit you, <em>kisses</em> are presented;
when they go away, <em>kisses</em> also pass between you. If you meet any
body, <em>kisses</em> are plentifully distributed. In short, whatever you do, wherever
you go, you are sure of <em>kisses</em> in abundance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This is language sufficiently warm to prove that Erasmus
carried the feelings of a man under the cowl of a monk. Erasmus
was very accomplished: he is said to have imbibed from
Hans Holbein a fine taste for painting, and to have painted several
pictures whilst in the convent at Gouda.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holbein owed the patronage of Henry VIII. to Erasmus, for
at his request it was that he came to London, and by him was introduced
to Sir Thomas More, who employed and entertained
him in his own house for three years, during which his likenesses,
and the execution of his works, attracted the notice of the king,
who took him into his service, and paid him as long as he lived:
although he once hazarded the severest displeasure of his royal
and turbulent patron; for being dispatched by Cromwell to paint
the Lady Ann of Cleves, Holbein so flattered her with his pencil,
that Henry was induced to marry her; but when he discovered
how plain she really was, his anger turned from the painter to
the minister, and poor Cromwell lost his head because the unhappy
Ann was denounced by her royal husband for “a Flanders’
mare,” and not the Venus depicted by Holbein.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Amongst the churches, the only one I saw worthy of notice
was the cathedral of St. Lawrence, the tower of which I ascended,
and from its top commanded the greater part of the south of
Holland. The body of the church is very large. The walls, like all
the rest of the Dutch churches, are saddened over with a great
number of sable escutcheons, and the floor covered with rush bottom
chairs for the congregation when assembled. A magnificent
brass ballustrade of exquisite workmanship, separates the choir
from the nave.</p>

<p class='c007'>The church is used for various purposes: the synod of the
province and the presbytery of the town used to assemble in it;
I was informed they still continue to do so; and at the fairs, booths
are erected in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only monuments worthy of attention, and those merit but
little, are erected to the memories of Admiral Cornelius de Witt,
Johannes a Brakel, and Admiral Korlenaar. A magnificent organ
has been building for some years in this church: a very large but
inadequate sum of money has been subscribed for this superb
instrument, which is intended to rival the celebrated one at Haarlem,
but much more money will be necessary for that purpose:
the object of this measure is not out of homage to St. Cecilia, but
from a commercial spirit, that repines at hearing of the number
of persons who flock to Haarlem to hear its boasted instrument,
by which considerable sums of money in the course of the year
are expended in that city.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the honour of Holland, her seminaries of learning have
always been favourite objects with her government; and I was well
informed, that to the further promotion of this great and vital
source of the morals, order, and glory of nations, the king has
devoted much of his consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the choirs of this cathedral, the scholars of the charity schools
of the city, attended by their masters and professors, repair twice a
year to undergo a public examination, in the presence of the principal
officers of the state resident in the city, who are distinguished for their
learning, attended by some of the clergy. The rector, or first professor,
opens the meeting with a short speech in praise of <cite>Literature and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the Civil Magistracy</cite>: such of the pupils as are about to remove to the
university, pronounce an oration in praise of some illustrious prince,
or of Erasmus; on the dignity, ornament, and utility of sound learning
to a state; in praise of commerce and industry; on the baneful
consequence of passion and indolence; on fortitude, patience, concord,
and other moral virtues; they then conclude with a compliment
to their masters for their care of them, and to the magistrates
for honouring them with their presence; and finally, take leave of
their school-fellows, whom they exhort to pursue their studies indefatigably,
and to live in amity with each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal magistrates then present each of them with some
classical author, superbly bound and gilt: the juniors, who are to
remove to the higher classes, then come forward, and compliment
the magistrates and their masters in a sentence or two either of
verse or prose. The effect of this ceremony is increased by the
organ playing at its commencement and close.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reader will, I am sure, be gratified with this brief description
of a plan so generative of every good to the nation which
adopts it. Children, as soon as they can think, discover that they
are the peculiar care of their country; they are taught to respect
its laws, and by descanting upon, to imitate its most shining examples,
and to repay the paternal solicitude of the government, by
becoming useful or ornamental members of its community.</p>

<p class='c007'>Amidst the political storms which have agitated Holland for so
many years, more fatal to its prosperity than those of the ocean, in
which it almost appears to float, education has never been neglected:
to bestow upon his children decent and useful instruction, has ever
formed the anxious care of the Hollander: he feels that whilst he
trains their minds to habits of investigation and industry, he secures
to them, under any form of government, the sources of support
and advancement.</p>

<p class='c007'>This general diffusion of useful instruction made Holland
what she was in the most shining periods of her history, and whenever
its enlightening influence shall cease to be felt, as a commercial
country she must decline.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>The very few instances of cruelty which occurred in Holland
during the late revolution, have been very justly attributed to the
happy effects of education. Whenever any disposition to severity
evinced itself, an appeal to reason and humanity inclined it to forgive:
a memorable proof of this statement will hereafter appear in
the account of some of the revolutionary movements which occurred
at Amsterdam.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even an English merchant would be astonished to see the
wonderful arithmetical attainment of stripling clerks in any of the
Dutch compting-houses, and the quantity of complicated business
which they discharge in the course of the day, the order of their
books, the rapidity and certainty of their calculation, according to
the commercial habits and exchange of different countries, and the
variety of languages which they speak; to which may be added,
the great regularity and length of their attendance, and the decency
and propriety of their deportment.</p>

<p class='c007'>With proper modifications, what an example for our own
government, with respect to the sister kingdom, does Holland
present! And here I cannot but lament my inability to do justice
to the illustrious nobleman, to whose care his majesty has with
sound wisdom and discrimination committed the administration of
his government in Ireland. In his Grace the Duke of Bedford,
that unhappy and long neglected island has found an able, zealous,
and resolute friend and patron; who, shunning every ostentatious
display, and almost the eye of observation, has conferred upon that
country the salutary benefits of those measures which do honour
to the christian, the statesman, and the governor.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this nobleman, and to Lord Somerville, the British nation
is indebted for having discerned the utility, and encouraged the
progress of a system of education, which has entirely originated
from the benevolent zeal and ability of Mr. Lancaster, a member
of a religious community long known, as well for the purity of
their minds as for the simplicity of their dress and deportment,
who, after many arduous experiments, has matured a plan by which
one thousand poor children may be taught and governed by one
master, for the trifling expense of five shillings per annum for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>each child: a plan which is eminently honourable to its meritorious
discoverer, and promises fair to effect an incalculable amelioration
in the habits and condition of the rising generation.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are not allowed upon the continent to be a people of much
<em>creative faculty</em>, but this plan is solely of British growth, and till
lately wholly unknown to political economists of every other
country. This cheap and efficacious system, which has received, to
their lasting honour, the cordial approbation and support of their
Majesties and the Royal Family, his Grace the Duke of Bedford is
anxious to introduce into Ireland, wholly free from religious proselytism,
and which would powerfully accelerate those comprehensive
and enlightened measures, to which another great
friend to Ireland has, with uncommon promptitude and assiduity,
obtained the assent of the imperial parliament; I allude to that
amiable and able statesman Sir John Newport, the present chancellor
of the exchequer of Ireland.</p>

<p class='c007'>May the happy effects of such a measure be as forcibly experienced
in that country, as they have been in this which I am
describing!</p>

<p class='c008'>It is with great reluctance I approach the subject of the currency
of Holland, but as I hope to be read by some one who may
hereafter visit that country, as much a stranger as I was to it, it
is fit that I should not omit it; and I hereby apprize all my <em>chair-travelling</em>
readers of my intention, that they may <em>leap</em> over my
<em>table</em> of coins if they choose so to do.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>SILVER COINS.</h3>

<p class='c017'>A doyt. Worth about half a farthing.</p>

<p class='c014'>A stiver. About a penny at par. Twelve stivers are generally, but
not in every part of Holland, considered equal to a shilling.
This coin resembles a silver penny.</p>

<p class='c014'>Dubbeltje, or two stiver piece. This coin is very convenient small
change.</p>

<p class='c014'>A quarter guilder, or five stiver piece. This coin, I am told, is
very rare; I met with none of it.</p>

<p class='c014'>A zesthalven, or five stivers and four doyts. This is a piece of
base metal, and equal to an English six-pence; it is very convenient
for an English traveller, on account of its precise value
being known.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Schellingen, of various kinds, the size of which determines the
value, unless they are stamped.</p>

<p class='c014'>Six and a half stiver piece. A silver piece, little larger than a six-pence,
and the eighth part of a rix-dollar.</p>

<p class='c014'>Eight stiver piece. A larger, but thinner piece than a schellingen,
not much in circulation.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ten stiver piece. Worth half a guilder, very scarce.</p>

<p class='c014'>Twelve and a half stiver piece. Not much in use.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thirteen stiver piece. A Zealand coin, and much in circulation.</p>

<p class='c014'>A guilder or florin, or twenty stiver piece. The legitimate coin of
Holland, by which they calculate, and is the best silver.</p>

<p class='c014'>Twenty-four stiver piece, or half a rix-dollar.</p>

<p class='c014'>Twenty-six stiver piece.</p>

<p class='c014'>Twenty-eight stiver piece. There are many sorts of this in Holland:
it is usual to receive five in a lot, each of which is equal
to seven guilders.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thirty stiver piece, or dollar. Of the value of half a crown English,
and about that size.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thirty-one and a half stiver piece, or half a ducatoon. They are
rare.</p>

<p class='c014'>Forty stiver piece, or two guilder piece. Not common.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fifty stiver piece. The antient rix-dollar; not much in use.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fifty-two stiver piece, or modern rix-dollar. Much in circulation:
in Amsterdam, and several other places, they will not pass for
more than 50 or 51 stivers. In Zealand they are worth 53.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sixty stiver piece, called a three guilder piece. Much in use.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sixty-three stiver piece, or ducatoon. Coined when the Spaniards
were in the country.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>GOLD COINS.</h3>

<p class='c017'>A ducat. A beautiful coin, of the purest fine gold. The Jews and the
brokers generally deal in this coin, for which they receive two
or three stivers profit on each. It is thin, and remarkably pleasant
to the touch; and as a proof of its purity, it will bear to be
frequently bent, without breaking. Upon almost every part of
the continent this coin bears a premium, and is current
throughout Europe.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>A double ducat is ten guilders ten stivers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Rider, fourteen guilders.</p>

<p class='c014'>Half rider, seven guilders. These are current through the
provinces.</p>

<p class='c007'>I would recommend the traveller to carry with him a sufficient
number of guineas for his return to England, as they are scarce
and very dear; for twelve guineas I paid an exchange of 35–4
agio 104 on 145, or 13<em>l.</em> 4<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em></p>

<h3 class='c016'>COINS.</h3>

<p class='c019'>No alteration has taken place in the legends of the coins of
Holland. Since the revolution there has been a copious silver
coinage, but the florin has remained the same for more than a
century. The old calendar is adhered to, with the slight alterations
rendered necessary by a change in the name and spirit of the
government.</p>

<p class='c007'>The practice of vails-giving still continues in Holland. Previous
to my going to dine with some acquaintances which I made at
Rotterdam, I was particularly reminded by a friend who knew the
habits of the country, not to forget to carry a few florins with me,
as the servant who opened the door, upon my quitting the house,
would expect either one or two of those pieces. This abominably
mean practice existed in England in a higher degree, and still
continues in part in the shape of card money.</p>

<p class='c007'>If I remember correctly, we are indebted to Mr. Hanway the
philanthropist, whose life is given in a very entertaining manner
by his pupil and protégé, Mr. Pugh, for the abolition of giving
vails to servants; previous to which, a gentleman of moderate income
could scarcely afford to dine with an opulent and fashionable
friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>In houses of great resort in Holland, servants are in the habits
of purchasing their places of their masters free of wages, solely
for the douceurs which custom rigidly exacts from the visitor. At
one table a friend of mine, a thoughtless Englishman, was reminded
of his having forgotten the usage, by having a quantity of
soup poured over his new coat by <em>accidental design</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>In the streets I was much gratified by seeing the fruit and vegetable
sellers: the fruit was abundant, very fresh, and fine, and
such as is usually to be found at the same season in England: the
vegetables are remarkably excellent, and are submitted to the eye
in the cleanest and most attractive manner. The Dutch potatoes
are small and uncommonly good; I think they are, if possible,
superior to those of Ireland.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proximity of the houses to the canals enables the Dutch
women to indulge to the full extent of their wishes, in scrubbing
and mopping their passages and rooms, which they do from the
first to the last blush of day; indeed, cleanliness in their houses
is carried to a painful excess. All the strong features of an English
Saturday evening, viz. mops, pails, scrubbing-brushes, dusters,
fullers’ earth, are in active use every hour of the day, in Holland;
and a little hand garden-engine is in perpetual requisition, for
washing the outside of the windows.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the aqua-terrene nymphs to whose hands these right useful
instruments are committed, appear to be so solicitous of removing
every feculent impression of the foot in their white-tiled
halls, of giving a brilliant polish to the brass knockers, and of preserving
the furniture of the rooms unsullied, that they frequently
neglect to purify their own persons; the charms of which are to
be often seen mingled with, if not obscured by, the accretions of
long neglect and inattention.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some travellers have extended similar remarks to the higher
classes of the female sex, but unquestionably with more spleen
than truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>I had the honour of being acquainted with many Dutch ladies
of respectability, and found them to be very neat in their persons,
but my first remark too powerfully applies to the lower orders of
the sex: they have no leisure to attend to themselves: to them,
with a little transposition of the sentiment, may be applied the facetious
lines that described a once celebrated opposition financier.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>I remember while at Amsterdam a servant was very angry
because I would not suffer her to wash my bedroom every day. It
might be supposed that in a climate which must be naturally very
humid, the natives would prefer having dry rooms as long as
possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon some of the canals I saw Rhine boats of extraordinary
dimensions; they were principally laden with hardware, and their
owners and families resided wholly on board, in a suite of cabins,
generally raised upon the deck, which, in point of commodious
arrangement, of neatness and comfort, cannot easily be surpassed
on shore. Upon the fore and aft part of the deck their ware is exposed
to sale, and below are prodigious depots of the same articles.
These vessels are frequently six months in their voyage up and
down the Rhine, in consequence of their stopping at those cities
or towns situated on its banks, where the owners are likely to have
a market for their merchandize.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reader will be surprised to hear that in several shops I
saw many prints of our illustrious Nelson, in which the artist, in
order to prevent the beholder from doubting that he had lost the
sight of one eye in the service of his country, had the optic completely
removed from its socket, and left a large frightful hole, for
the purpose of illustrating this part of his heroic history.</p>

<p class='c007'>At an excellent <i><span lang="fr">table d’hote</span></i>, at the Mareschal de Turenne,
I had the happiness of meeting several of my countrymen, who
were returning to England after a long and most unjust detention
at Verdun; from them I learned that specie was abundant in
France, and that Napoleon scarcely admitted any paper to be in
circulation; that the roads were no longer farmed, but by the aid
of a small additional duty on salt, were put into the finest condition,
and that no toll whatever was taken in any part of the empire. They
said, that in point of restriction, they were not rigidly treated, but
that there were no bounds to the rapacity of those appointed to
look after them, particular of the <i><span lang="fr">gens d’armes</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The collections of paintings in Rotterdam are not numerous,
but very select: perhaps no people upon the face of the earth ever
displayed a more inveterate and immoveable attachment to every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>thing of native growth than the Dutch, except the Chinese, who
consider improvement as penal innovation, and who confined a
native in irons for life, because he ventured to make a boat upon a
new construction, by which it sailed faster than any other.</p>

<p class='c007'>This immoveable adhesion to old customs in the Dutch, is the
more singular, as from their commercial character, they have
been in constant intercourse with the natives of every quarter of
the globe, the various produces of which they have brought into
their own canals, but not for adoption, imitation, or, generally
speaking, for consumption, but solely for profitable re-sale.</p>

<p class='c007'>This spirit, or if you like to call it so, this <i><span lang="la">amor patriæ</span></i>, is
strongly evinced in all their collections of paintings: in only one
or two private cabinets in Holland are to be found any productions
of the Italian and Venetian schools.</p>

<p class='c007'>The finest private cabinet belongs to M. Vanderpals, a very
rich and respectable merchant; it is principally filled by the
works of those delightful masters Nicholas Berchem, and Linglebach;
of the former I shall give a few striking anecdotes when
I reach Haarlem, the place of his nativity; of the latter I shall
briefly speak when I describe Frankfort on the Maine, where he
was born.</p>

<p class='c007'>M. Vanderpot, another wealthy merchant, has also a very large
and well selected collection of the Dutch and Flemish painters. M.
Lockhorst, a gentleman of commercial distinction, has also a fine
assortment of pictures of the same school.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proprietors of these valuable productions are always ready
with the greatest politeness to gratify strangers with the sight of
them. Amongst other artists, Rotterdam has the honour of giving
birth to the Chevalier Vanderwerf, who was born in 1659, and
received his first instructions from Picolet, a portrait painter; he
afterwards studied under Eglon Vanderneer, under whom he made
a rapid improvement: he principally confined himself to historical
subjects of a small size. The Elector Palatine conceived a great
fondness for him, from accidentally seeing some of his performances
in that style; this prince honoured him with every mark of
esteem and beneficence. He conferred upon him the honour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>knighthood, ennobled his descendants, gave him a chain of gold
and a medal, and his portrait set with diamonds of great value, and
allowed him a noble pension, besides paying him munificently for
his productions; and upon the wife of Vanderwerf presenting him
with a picture drawn by herself, their royal patron bestowed upon
her husband six thousand florins, and on the lady a magnificent
toilette of silver. What a model of munificence and liberal policy
for princes! The pictures of this eminent master are very rare,
and bear very high prices. He is principally celebrated for the
roundness and relief of his figures; his defect lay in a coldness
of colouring. Upon his pictures he laboured with unsparing toil,
which injured the spirit of his productions.</p>

<p class='c007'>His brother, Peter Vanderwerf, was born near Rotterdam in
1665, and was the pupil of his brother Adrian. His principal subjects
were portraits and conversations, which entitled him to rank
as a very able artist, and as a further proof of it, a small picture of his
sold, in 1713, for five hundred and fifty guilders; and another, a
copy from one of his brother Adrian’s, for eight hundred guilders.
I did not hear of any living painter at Rotterdam of very distinguished
eminence, a circumstance somewhat singular, when it is
considered how many fine artists, though inferior to Vanderwerf,
that city has produced.</p>

<p class='c007'>The perfection to which the Dutch and Flemish schools arrived,
proves that great artists may be formed, without the assistance
of great galleries. The present low state of the French school demonstrates,
that the most magnificent collection ever known, containing
the renowned and exalted specimens of art, and opened to
the inspection of every one with a becoming spirit of liberality,
cannot form good artists. The St. Jerome of Corregio, and the
St. Cecilia of Michael Angelo, have created no successful disciple
since their arrival at Paris.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Dort, or Dordreght, a city of great antiquity, about nine
miles from Rotterdam, resides a celebrated artist of the name of
Varestage, aged about fifty; he is justly celebrated for his candlelight
subjects, which are masterly: one of his works, a school by
candlelight, and a number of children, is spoken of as truly exquisite.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>On account of his eyes growing weak, he has altered his
manner, and at present confines himself to large figures, portraits,
and conversations.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I was informed there was nothing very attractive at Dort,
I did not visit that city: it is however famous for having given birth
to several able men. John Gerard Vossius studied there in 1577,
and wrote a great number of learned works; he was the father of
Issac Vossius, also a man of profound erudition. Our King Charles
humourously observed of him, alluding to his credulity and infidelity,
“that he would believe any thing <em>but the Bible</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Adrian Junius was born here in 1511, and was considered to
be one of the most profound men of his country, and wrote many
learned works. Dr. Johnson observes of Junius, in the preface to
his Dictionary, “the votaries of the northern muses will not perhaps
easily restrain their indignation, when they find the name of
Junius thus degraded by a disadvantageous comparison, (alluding
to Skinner); but whatever reverence is due to his diligence, or his
attainments, it can be no criminal degree of censoriousness, to
charge that etymologist with want of judgment, who can seriously
derive <em>dream</em> from <em>drama</em>, because life is a drama, and a drama is a
dream.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It would be an inexpiable offence to pass over the name of Albert
Kuyp, or Cuyp, who was born here, son of the well known
Jacob Gerritze Kuyp, whose pupil he was, and whom he infinitely
surpassed. The former excelled in whatever he attempted to represent;
the diffusion of his lights is as exquisite as it is natural,
and the very times of the day in which he painted are immediately
discoverable; the misty haze of the morning, the brilliant lustre
of noon, the last blush of evening, and the lunar beam of night
from his hands, presented the closest imitations of nature, and the
utmost powers the art is susceptible of. Most of his subjects were
furnished by his native city and the adjacent scenery, particularly
his celebrated representation of the cattle-market at Dort, and the
square where the troops exercised: his works are much sought
after, and preserved as great curiosities; and yet, though now so
highly prized, they fell into so much disrepute, that not many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>years since, a large collection of his best pictures sold for eight
guineas apiece, so uncertain is the opinion and taste of the public.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even our immortal Cowper experienced the severity of popular
caprice. So diffidently did he think of his abilities, that he offered
his first poems to his publisher; reserving only as a remuneration, a
few copies to present to his friends, from an apprehension that
his works might produce rather loss than profit. These productions
were, on their first appearance, very rudely handled by most
of the reviewers, and nearly the whole of the copies lay like so
much waste paper for a long time in the bookseller’s shop.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some time afterwards, not wholly discouraged by this mortifying
neglect, he presented through the hands of a friend, his manuscript
copy of that divine poem, “<cite>The Task</cite>” upon the same terms,
the merit of which, dispelled the folly or ignorance of the town,
as the rays of the sun pierce through and absorb the mist, and
Cowper took a high rank amongst the living great men of his century;
the fame of “The Task” brought into light his former discarded
productions, and their sale has ever since continued to augment
the wealth of his bookseller, the venerable and much respected
Johnson.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following very interesting and extraordinary circumstance
occurred at Dort in the year 1785, which is still the frequent narrative
of the young and old of that city, who relate it with mingled sensations
of awe and delight, as an interposition of Divine Providence
in favour of a widow and her family of this city. This woman,
who was very industrious, was left by her husband, an eminent
carpenter, a comfortable house with some land, and two boats for
carrying merchandize and passengers on the canals. She was also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>supposed to be worth ten thousand guilders in ready money, which
she employed in a hempen and sail-cloth manufactory, for the
purpose of increasing her fortune and instructing her children (a
son and two daughters) in useful branches of business.</p>

<p class='c007'>One night about nine o’clock, when the workmen were gone home,
a person dressed in uniform, with a musket and broad sword, came
to her house, and requested a lodging. “I let no lodgings, friend,”
said the widow, “and besides, I have no spare bed, unless you sleep
with my son, which I think very improper, on account of your
being a perfect stranger to us all.” The soldier then shewed a discharge
from Diesbach’s regiment (signed by the Major, who
gave him an excellent character), and a passport from Compte
Maillebois, governor of Breda. The widow, believing the stranger
to be an honest man, called her son, and asked him if he would
accommodate a veteran, who had served the republic thirty years
with reputation, with part of his bed. The young man consented;
the soldier was accordingly hospitably entertained; and at a seasonable
hour withdrew to rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some hours afterwards, a loud knocking was heard at the street
door, which roused the soldier, who moved softly down stairs, and
listened at the hall door, when the blows were repeated, and the
door almost broken through by a sledge, or some heavy instrument.
By this time the widow and her daughters were much alarmed
by this violent attack, and ran almost frantic through different
parts of the house, exclaiming “Murder! Murder!” The son
having joined the soldier with a case of loaded pistols, and the
latter screwing on his bayonet and fresh priming his piece, which
was charged with slugs, requested the women to keep themselves
in a back room out of the way of danger. Soon after the
door was bursted in, two ruffians entered, and were instantly shot
by the son, who discharged both his pistols at once. Two other
associates of the dead men immediately returned the fire, but
without effect, when the intrepid and veteran stranger, taking immediate
advantage of the discharge of their arms, rushed on them
like a lion, ran one through the body with his bayonet, and whilst
the other was running away, lodged the contents of his piece between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>his shoulders, and he dropped dead on the spot. The son
and the stranger then closed the door as well as they could, reloaded
their arms, made a good fire, and watched till day-light,
when the weavers and spinners of the manufactory came to resume
their employment, who were struck with horror and surprise at
seeing four men dead on the dunghill adjoining the house, where
the soldier had dragged them before they closed the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>The burgomaster and his syndic attended, and took the depositions
of the family relative to this affair. The bodies were buried
in a cross-road, and a stone erected over the grave, with this inscription:
“Here lie the remains of four unknown ruffians, who
deservedly lost their lives, in an attempt to rob and murder a
worthy woman and her family. A stranger who slept in the house,
to which Divine Providence undoubtedly directed him, was the
principal instrument in preventing the perpetration of such horrid
designs, which justly entitles him to a lasting memorial, and the
thanks of the public. John Adrian de Gries, a discharged soldier
from the regiment of Diesbach, a native of Middleburgh in Zealand,
and upwards of seventy years old, was the David who slew two
of these Goliaths, the rest being killed by the son of the family. In
honorem, a gratitudine ergo, Dei optimi maximi, pietatis et innocentæ
summi protectoris, magistratus et concilium civitatis Dortrechiensis
hoc signum poni curavere, xx. die Nov. annoque salutis
humanæ, 1785.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The widow presented the soldier with one hundred guineas,
and the city settled a handsome pension on him for the rest of his
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is matter of surprise to the contemplative traveller to observe
in a country apparently so mechanically moral and regular
as Holland, the glaring defects of the most loose and meretricious
government: in the hearts of the finest cities are to be found
brothels surpassing in iniquity all such seats of impurity in any
other nation, in which the horrible novelty of the most savage oppression
is united to a public, licensed, and authorised display of
vice and profligacy. I mean the spill-houses, to one of which my
laquais de place conducted me about ten o’clock at night, when
those scenes of revelry open. In a street, in an inferior quarter of
the town, the sound of fiddles and dancing announced the approach
to one of these houses: presently my guide stopped before one of
them, into the saloon of which he introduced me by pulling aside
a curtain drawn before the door, near which, in a little raised orchestra,
two fiddlers were scraping; upon benches at the other
end of the room were seven or eight females, painted and dressed
in all their finery, with large silver buckles, loose muslin robes,
massy gilt ear-rings, and ornaments of the same metal round the
head. Most of them looked very jaded. As soon as I entered, a
bottle of wine and glasses, and pipes and tobacco, were put before
me, for which I paid a florin, and which is considered as the premium
of admission.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>These miserable wretches were all prostitutes and prisoners, confined
to this haunt of vice, and never suffered to pass its threshold
until enabled, out of the wages of prostitution, to redeem themselves.
The way in which they are ensnared into this brothel-dungeon is
worthy of notice. The keeper of it hears of some girl who is in
debt, frequently occasioned by dressing beyond her means, to set
off her person to advantage at some of the music-rooms or other
public places; he approaches her, pities her, offers her money to
discharge her debts, advances her more for immediate and future
purposes; she becomes his debtor: in a short time he seizes upon
her person, and bears her away to his bagnio, and receives the
profligate produce of her disgrace and infamy; and this scene of
compound enormity is tolerated by the government, and has so
continued for many years, till time has hardened the cruel practice
into a custom which has become inoffensive to the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of these poor wretches approached me; the affected
gaiety of her deportment, so entirely discordant with the genuine
feelings of a mind exposed to scenes of such humiliating profligacy,
was in no little degree distressing; but I observed she drank
the wine I gave her with a heavy heart, and some money I presented
her with, excited expressions of gratitude, but no emotions
of delight; from which I concluded that she was merely the channel
through which my present would pass to her brutal gaoler; an
apprehension which was confirmed to me by my lacquey upon my
quitting this scene of complicated wretchedness.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a curious circumstance that to Solon, the wisest amongst
the wise men of Greece, is attributed the origin of brothels: his
motives may be appreciated in the following extracts. “<span lang="fr">Nicandre
raconte dans le troisième livre des choses remarquables de Colophon,
que le legislateur Solon a été le premier qui ait bâti un
temple à <cite>Venus Pandemos</cite>. Philemon (Athenée liv. xiii. p. 569.)
loue beaucoup la sage indulgence que Solon a témoignée par cette
loi pour la foiblesse humaine: ‘Solon, tu as vraiment été le bienfaiteur
du genre humain! car on dit que c’est toi qui a le premier
pensé à une chose bien advantageuse au peuple ou plutôt au salut
public. Oui, c’est avec raison que je dis ceci, lorsque je considère
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>notre ville pleine de jeunes gens d’un temperament bouillant, et qui
en consequence se porteraient à des excès impermissables. C’est
pourquoi tu as acheté des femmes, et les as placées dans des lieux,
où, pourvues de tout ce qui leur est nécessaire, elles deviennent
communes à tous ceux qui en veulent.</span>’” “Nicander relates in the
third book of remarkable circumstances of Colophon, that the legislator
Solon was the first who built a temple to Venus Pandemos.
Philemon praises much the wise indulgence which Solon has
shown by this law to human infirmity. ‘Solon! thou hast truly
been the benefactor of the human race! for it is said that thou first
thought of a measure greatly beneficial to the people, or rather to
the public good. Yes, I say it with reason, when I see our town
full of young men of warm constitutions, and who in consequence
would indulge in censurable excesses. Therefore thou hast purchased
women, and fixed them in places, where, provided with
every thing they want, they become accessible to all who desire an
intercourse with them.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Dutch are so familiarized to these scenes, that parents
frequently carry their children to them; from the hope of preserving
them from vicious propensities, by placing before their
eyes the nauseous and frightful images of suffering profligacy.
Such an experiment in morals would be somewhat dubious in its
operations; for vice like deformity ceases to disgust in proportion
as it is contemplated. Such ideas never enter the sober brains of
such visitors; they go to spend an hour, which to them is mirthful,
and the poor wretches I have mentioned augment the pleasures
of the scene by the gaudiness of their finery, and the company
add to its vivacity. In the beauty of its plumage, “they forget
the dying bird.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Through considerable interest I was enabled to see the Rasp-House, or prison for male and female culprits: it is a large quadrangular
building; most of the cells and rooms look towards the
yard, which is considerably below the level of the street. The food
is wholesome and abundant, and the chambers are kept very neat.
I saw in this place nothing objectionable but the period allowed to
the prisoners for taking exercise, which is infinitely too short and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>infrequent, each person being allowed to walk in the yard only
once in the week; the consequence is, that few of the prisoners
looked healthy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holland is justly celebrated for its public charities. In Rotterdam,
before the last war, there were many benevolent institutions,
some of which have inevitably languished, and others expired, in
consequence of the political convulsions of the country and the
usually impoverishing effects of long hostility.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the streets I was surprised to see the horses shod in the
shameful and clumsy manner they are: the shoe is behind elevated
to a considerable height, so that the poor animal must suffer from
the position into which he is always forced, resembling that of a
lady in a high-heeled pair of shoes of the last century.</p>

<p class='c007'>At my hotel I was much gratified by the whimsical appearance
of a meeting called the <cite>Society of Variety and Unity</cite>, which was
held there: about eighty Dutchmen of the middling classes of life
were assembled in one of the rooms, to discuss philosophical, but
more particularly religious questions: when I entered the room,
one of their members was addressing the body upon the subject
of death, as I was informed. His eloquence appeared to be as
sluggish as the canal opposite; the motto of the fraternity was well
illustrated by what appeared; the only <em>variety</em> I saw was in their
pipes, and their <em>unity</em> was effected by the fumes of their tobacco,
which seemed to blend them in one common mass of smoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>I had not been two days in Holland without witnessing the
abominable custom of introducing a spitting pot upon the table
after dinner, into which, like the Kava bowl used amongst the
natives of the South-sea islands, each person present who smokes,
and that generally comprehends all who are present, discharges
his saliva, which delicate depositary is handed round as regularly
as the bottle. This custom is comparable in point of delicacy with
that of washing the mouth and cleaning the teeth with a napkin
after dinner, as in England, or picking the latter with a fork, as in
France.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Dutch are proverbial for smoking. The moment I entered
any coffee-house, pipes and tobacco were introduced, as if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>waiters were in dread of my imbibing some pestilent disease, without
this sort of fumigation, and expressed uncommon surprise,
when they remarked that I declined using them. The Dutch will
insist upon it that smoking is not only as necessary to preserve
their constitutions, as paint is to protect the exterior of their houses
from the effects of their moist climate, but that the vapour invigorates
the mind, which mounted like an aerial spirit upon a
cloud, pours forth treasures of reflection with a brilliancy little
short of inspiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Dutch go to an astonishing expense in their pipes, which
assume an endless variety of shapes, and are decorated sometimes
with the most coxcombical figures painted upon the head or cup
of it, according to the taste of its possessor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of the opulent Hollanders use a pipe, the head of which
is made of a clay which is very rare, and found only in Turkey,
of so beautiful a colour, that is called the Meerschaum, or <em>froth of
the sea</em>; for this piece of luxury the value of eight and even ten
guineas is frequently paid.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lower orders of society, and many of the higher, carry in
their pockets their pipe, a pricker to clear the tube, a piece of tinder
made in Germany from the large mushrooms growing on old trees,
resembling spunge, a small steel and flint to kindle the fire with,
and a box frequently capacious enough to contain a pound of tobacco.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is curious to observe how naturally a pipe depends from a
Dutchman’s mouth, and with what perfect facility he smokes without
the assistance of either hand: he literally appears to have been
formed by nature to breathe through this tube, with which he rides
on horseback, drives in a carriage, and even dances. I have seen
little boys take this instrument and puff away with an apparently
instinctive predilection for the transatlantic weed. Smoking is a
Dutchman’s panacea, he thinks it good in all cases, whether of
consumptions, or plethora, nervous debility, or fiery fever: as a
masticatory, tobacco is but little used even by the fishermen, sailors
and boors; and I was surprised to find, that in the social shape of
snuff, it seemed to have not many admirers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Tobacco had many enemies to contend with. In 1610, the
smoking of tobacco was known at Constantinople, but it was
thought so injurious a custom, that to remove it by ridicule, a
Turk who had been found smoking, was conducted about the
streets with a pipe transfixed through his nose: it was a long time
before the Dutch cultivated the plant themselves; previous to that
period they purchased it, and that the very refuse of the English.
In 1615, tobacco began to be sown about Amsfort in Holland.</p>

<p class='c007'>By James I. the practice of smoking was severely and most
whimsically denounced in a work, called “<cite>King James the Sixth’s</cite>
(of Scotland) <cite>Counterblast to Tobacco</cite>,” in which the royal pedant
states, “that some gentlemen of his courts were accustomed to
expend no less than three or four hundred pounds a year upon
this indulgence.” He also says, “that it was used as a powerful
aphrodisiac.” He particularly deplores the case of delicate, wholesome,
clean complexioned wives, whose husbands were not ashamed
to pollute them with the <em>perpetual stinking torment</em> of tobacco
smoke: the concluding sentence of this extraordinary composition
is somewhat laughable. “The use of tobacco,” he says, “is a
custom loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the
brain, dangerous to the lungs, and in the black stinking fume
thereof, nearest resembling the horrid Stygian smoke of the pit
that is bottomless.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Few would wish to withhold from a Dutchman the narcotic
enjoyment of his pipe, when they reflect, that he seeks no other
species of oblivion to his care; for, I believe, notwithstanding a
Dutchman’s eulogium upon his pipe, that it produces more oblivion
than inspiration: he is scarcely ever seen intoxicated: indeed,
drunkenness is held unpardonably infamous in Holland. To keep
bad accounts, and to be seen inebriated, are equally disgraceful;
and hence the use of wines and spirituous liquors is much less in
Holland than in England.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Dutch agree with Cassio’s reasoning:</p>

<p class='c014'>——“Oh! that men should put an enemy into their mouths, to steal
away their brains! That we should with joy, revel, pleasure, and applause,
transform ourselves into beasts!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The spill-houses are not the only objectionable instances of the
abuse of the government; the police master is suffered to misuse
his authority to a shameful excess. Instead of bringing delinquents
to justice, he is in the frequent habit of privately compromising
public offence, and putting the sum paid into his own pocket. Some
time before I was in Rotterdam, a burgher who had been guilty of
adultery, paid twenty thousand guilders to this minister of justice,
who thus partaking of the commercial spirit of his country, becomes
a merchant in delinquency.</p>

<p class='c007'>I saw in several shops a great number of articles of English
manufacture exposed to sale, particularly Manchester goods. The
Dutch manufacture their own woollens, and they are esteemed to
be very good. The black cloth of Holland is very well known, which
is infinitely of a deeper and superior colour than ours. The principal
cloth manufactures are at Leyden and Tielburg. There are
also very capital and flourishing manufactures of velvets, silk, and
carpets, at Hilversom; and those of linen and table-cloths, which
are exquisite, at Overyssel; and numerous paper-mills.</p>

<p class='c007'>The population of Rotterdam is estimated at sixty thousand
inhabitants. Upon the whole, it is a gloomy place to live in; a
constant iteration of the same canals, bridges, boats, houses, and
figures, will soon damp the spirits of a traveller, unless naturally
very vivacious. There is no theatre, no place of public amusement,
but the spill-houses I have described, which are as much, at least
to feeling minds, not accustomed to them, entitled to that appellation,
as any of our houses of correction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here I bade adieu to my companions and friends, who proceeded
direct to Germany, where I promised to rejoin them. I
was by no means sorry to follow a lacquey to that quarter of the
suburbs where the Delft boats set off every two hours, with my
portmanteau, and to bid adieu to Rotterdam. Our treckschuyt lay
ready for starting; at two o’clock, a little bell fastened on the outside
of a house where the director resides, announced that all
was ready; the horse was fastened to a very long, and rather a thin
line, and we slipped through the <em>liquid road</em>, sensible of moving
only from passing the objects that lined the sides of the canal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>consisting for a considerable way of pretty houses and avenues of
trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>The treckschuyt is a long barge divided into two apartments;
the after one, called the ruif or roof, possesses superior accommodations,
and will hold from eight to a dozen persons, and the other
from forty to fifty: this vessel, which is drawn by a single horse,
moves so precisely at the rate of four miles an hour, that the
Dutch always compute by the hour instead of the mile.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c021'><sup>[1]</sup></a> In the
cabin or roof, there are four oblique windows, which move up and
down, a table in the middle, with a long drawer filled with pipes.
The seats are covered with handsome cushions; but the prime
accommodations are a spitting-box, and a little iron pot filled with
burning turf, to furnish the smokers with fire for their pipes. The
price is about three pence an hour: this part is generally occupied
by persons of a superior condition. So steady is the motion of the
vessel, that the passenger may read, write, or draw in it, without
interruption.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The Dutch boors are also so regular in smoking their pipes, that in
calculating the distances of places, they say they are so many pipes
asunder.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The treckschuyts preserve an easy intercourse between the
most distant parts of the kingdom, and the cheapness of their conveyance
places them within the reach of the most slender purse.
Every thing relative to these vessels is conducted with such admirable
punctuality, that the passenger can tell to the smallest
cost in the kingdom what his expenses will amount to, and to a
minute when he shall arrive at the end of his journey, in which,
if it be long, he carries his provision with him, or purchases a frugal
meal at the house where the boat stops a few minutes for that
purpose. At those places where the treckschuyts stop on account
of the course of the canal being interrupted, and where passengers
are in consequence obliged to quit one vessel to go to another,
there are females who offer refreshments for sale, consisting of
little rolls and small birds, and slices of cold baked eels, fastened
to a small stick.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>The treckschuyts are all under the direction of government,
and are truly punctual, convenient, cheap, and agreeable. The
town of Delft was about twelve miles, or three hours distant. On
the sides of the canal, the surface of the water was frequently covered
by the <em>nymphæa alba</em>, a magnificent white water-lily, whose
expanded and unsullied flowers had a charming effect, particularly
when intermixed with <em>menyanthes nymphoides</em>, the yellow fringed
water-lily, which are very uncommon in England.</p>

<p class='c007'>We passed by several sawing or wood mills, which are moved
by wind: the machinery of those buildings, which I afterwards examined,
is very curious; they were originally invented by Corneille
Van Uitgust. The flies of the mill are fixed to a large beam,
which turns on an axis; in the centre of the beam the principal
wheel is fixed, which impels one immediately below it, which is
also fixed on the middle of a piece of timber, hanging on an axis,
to which four perpendicular saws, ten in each compartment, are
fastened, which, as the wheel revolves, are elevated and depressed.
Two iron hooks are fastened at the end of this beam, which catch
a wheel, and as the saw rises and falls, move this wheel one cog;
that wheel impels another, which catches into a piece of iron, and
draws it towards itself; at the end of this iron there is a cross bar,
which presses against the end of the tree, while the other end is
sawing, and gradually forces it on to the teeth of the saws, as they
proceed in cutting.</p>

<p class='c007'>I remember at Memel, in Polish Prussia, the sawing mills
there had another mechanical power, that of drawing up the trees
from the barks in which they were brought in the river, into the
yard or store-house. I believe mills for sawing timber have been
introduced only partially into England. All the mills in Holland
rise to a very great height, to secure as much wind at all times as
possible. Many of these mills were thatched on the sides as well
as the roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very ingenious discovery, infinitely more curious than the
Dutch sawing-mill, has, however, been recently made in London,
by Sir George Wright, Bart. of machinery for sawing stone, for
which a patent has been obtained, now the property of Samuel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Hill, Esq. who has added many improvements to it. By means of
a steam-engine, a number of saws are set in motion, by which a
solid block of marble or stone, rough from the quarry, can be cut
into shafts of columns of diminishing diameters, one within the
other, at the same time: the blocks fixed in an iron circular frame,
resting upon four small wheels, by which they can be turned round
by the person who has the care of a certain number of them, to
keep the saws, which are almost in a horizontal position, constantly
acting upon them; the blocks are a little inclined, to enable
the saws to be supplied with water from a trough above, conducted
by means of tin pipes to the respective orifices.</p>

<p class='c007'>By means of this admirable invention, a saving of three-fourths
of the stone is produced upon a block of large diameter; the outer
cases being as strong as the cube, <em>five</em> men can perform the work
which occupied <em>forty</em> before the discovery; and stone columns are
reduced to the price of wooden ones. These saws can also cut out
an entire gothic window, which they effect at a saving of eighty per
cent. with great beauty and precision, and which in its former
construction was divided into six different parts; the last savings
or cubes, upon being cemented together, constitute a complete gothic
column, and the concavity of the divided outer case of a large
column forms an entire recess; a block will also, after it has afforded
several shafts of columns, form a handsome series of chimnies.
The pipes for conveying water by this machinery are much
preferred, on account of their durability: the proprietors of several
public works have adopted them in preference to those of wood,
which are continually wanting repairs. This highly ingenious
discovery has been matured and prosecuted with great public spirit
and expense by the proprietor, and promises, from its great
utility and economy, to become an object of high national importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>In our treckschuyt, I witnessed a strong contrast to the spirits
and loquacity of the French and Germans; all was smoke and
silence, save when it yielded to a few short sentences, in which
the word <em>mi vrow</em> frequently met my ear. One very grave elderly
gentleman, who wore an enormous curled and powdered wig, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>who somewhat resembled Lord Burleigh in the Critic, spoke but
once all the way, and that was in the following oracular sentence;
“<i><span lang="nl">Wat is goed voor de man is ook goed voor de vrow</span></i>—What is
good for the husband, is as good for the wife;” so similar in many
instances are the Dutch and English languages, that some of our
witlings have observed that bad English will make very good
Dutch. M. Siegenbeek, minister of the anabaptist church at Leyden,
and the first who has occupied the chair for Dutch literature
and eloquence in the university of that city, in which, by his genius
and attainments, he reflects honour upon his country, has published
a very ingenious work, entitled, <cite>Verhandeling over de Nederduitsche
Spelling</cite>; a Treatise on Dutch Orthography, tending to
render it uniform: this work and another by the same author,
called <cite>Verhandeling over den Ionsted, &#38;c.</cite> or a Treatise on the Influence
of Euphony or agreeable Sound, and of the Facility of
Pronunciation, on the orthography of the Dutch language, were,
at the instigation and by the able exertions of M. Vander Palm,
the agent of national education, some years since published, for
the improvement of the national language and poetry. The late
Batavian government adopted the system of orthography proposed
by M. Siegenbeek, and ordered it to be used by all the offices of
administration.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is generally understood that the language of Holland is divided
into High and Low Dutch, whereas there is but one pure
language, as in England, which is called Neder Duitch, the language
of the Netherlands, or of a country lying very low. In
Holland, as in every other country, there is a variety of provincial
idioms; for instance, a raw native of Friesland would not be understood
at Amsterdam.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the Dutch language our immortal lexicographer, Johnson,
says, “Our knowledge of the northern literature is so scanty, that
of words undoubtedly Teutonic the original is not always to be
found in any ancient language, and I have therefore inserted Dutch
or German substitutes, which I consider not as radical, but parallel;
not as the parent of, but as sisters to the English.” To close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>this digression, the language, I must confess, did not sound dissonant
to my ear from the lips of well-bred persons.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>My companions continued smoking, and enjoying the delightful
novelty of our aquatic conveyance and the surrounding scenery.
We met several boats, and the dexterity by which the line was
slackened by one boat, to permit the other, which kept its towing
mast standing, to pass over the cord, according to the custom
which governs this sort of rencontre on the canal, was admirable,
as also was the ease and skill with which the skipper who has the
care of the line throws it up on one side, and catches it on the
other of a bridge under which the boat is obliged to pass.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Overchie, a village about three miles, or one hour from Rotterdam,
the houses are close to the water, and little children were
playing on its very margin without exciting any apprehension. In
this town the prospect of a late dinner induced me to taste its gingerbread,
for which Holland is very justly celebrated. Before every
cottage, brass kettles and pans just cleaned were placed upon stools
in the open air, or were polishing under the hands of their indefatigable
owners; and even certain utensils shone with such resplendent
brightness in the sun, that the well-known saying which
the French whimsically apply to the grave and thoughtful, <span lang="fr">Il est
sérieux comme un pot de chambre</span>, would lose the fidelity of its
resemblance here.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>We were passed by several curricles, a very common carriage
in this part of Holland, the horses in rope harness, going to and
from Rotterdam. In the roof of the boat were some ladies and gentlemen,
who, as well as I could discern through the smoke, seemed
pleased to see me so with their country. The land all the way on
each side was rich pasture. On our left, a short distance from
Delft, we passed a cannon foundry, and on our right some potteries,
where the Delft china, formerly much prized all over Europe,
and which Vandevelt and other eminent artists embellished with
their pencils, used to be manufactured in great abundance. These
potteries, since last war, have greatly declined, to the severe injury
of the adjoining town.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal cause of the decay of these potteries has been
the vast quantities of porcelain which, for more than a century
and a half, have been imported from China into Europe, and the
great improvement of that beautiful manufacture in England and
Germany. Some years since the earth-ware of Staffordshire was so
much admired in Holland, that to protect the manufacture of Delft
from utter ruin, the States General imposed a duty upon its importation
into the republic, that nearly amounted to a prohibition.
Hence the name of an Englishman is not very popular in Delft.
I tasted some excellent beer in this town, which is celebrated for
its breweries, and produces an admirable imitation of London bottled
porter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The town is very ancient and picturesque; at the place where
we disembarked, were several treckschuyts moored under an old
castellated gateway, from which, preceded by a commissary or licensed
porter, who attends the moment the boat arrives, with his
wheelbarrow, to convey the luggage of the passengers, we entered
Delft, the capital of Delftland, in the province of Holland, and proceeded
to a very comfortable inn, which furnished some good cutlets,
and a bottle of claret. Before the hotel all was bustle, from the
number of carriages filled with genteel people proceeding to, and
returning from the Hague, to and from which boats are passing
every half hour.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Here, as in every inn in Holland, however humble, the guest has
always the comfort of a silver fork placed by his side, and a tablecloth
of snowy whiteness: in the room where I dined was a glass
china cupboard, and every article within it bore shining testimony
to its having received a due proportion of diurnal care. Delft is a
large but gloomy town, and as silent as a monastery, except in
the street immediately leading to the Hague; upon quitting which,
no sound was to be heard but that of mops and buckets: narrow,
green, stagnant canals divide most of the streets, which are generally,
for some little distance before the houses, paved with black and white
marble. However, the principal part of the town is handsome, having
two spacious streets, with broad canals bordered with trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>The navigation is interrupted from the Rotterdam entrance to
that of the Hague, so that the water within it presents no animating
object. In this town turf is principally burnt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the taciturnity of the place would induce a stranger
to think its population small, it reckons 13,000 inhabitants, 6000
of whom, since the war, have been reduced to the class of paupers.
I met with two or three inhabitants who spoke good English, and
expressed in terms of feeling misery, the heavy losses and distresses
which they had sustained by a rupture with England; yet, strange
as it may appear, they seemed to think well of their new government,
and spoke with great esteem of their king, of whom they
said they well knew, he felt the impolicy of a war with England
as much as any Dutchman, and that he would rejoice at the hour,
when the great political events which were passing in other parts
of the world, would admit of a renewal of amity and free intercourse
with that country; they spoke of the government of the
Stadtholder with contempt, and of the Republic with detestation.</p>

<p class='c007'>I visited the new church, the tower of which is very fine,
and of a prodigious altitude. The first object that excited my
curiosity, was the tomb of the immortal Grotius, whose remains
were brought here, after he expired at Rostock, in 1645, upon his
return from the court of Christina, Queen of Sweden, to this, his
native city. The tomb erected to his memory is simple, but handsome;
it consists of a medallion representing the head of this great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>man, and a child leaning upon an urn with a torch inverted. The
epitaph in latin is elegant, and expressive of the merits and virtues
it perpetuates. I regret, upon opening my memorandums, to find
my pencil copy of it so effaced as to be unintelligible: of this great
civilian and general scholar, Aubere du Marier, who knew him
very intimately said, “that he was tall, strong, and a well made
man, and had a very agreeable countenance. With all those excellences
of body, his mind was still more excellent. He was a man
of openness, of veracity, and of honour, and so perfectly virtuous,
that throughout his whole life, he made a point of avoiding and
of deserting men of bad character, but of seeking the acquaintance
of men of worth, and persons distinguished by talents, not only of
his own country, but of all Europe, with whom he kept up an
epistolary correspondence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Grotius displayed great precocity of talents. At the age of
fifteen, he accompanied the Dutch ambassador, Barneveldt, into
France, and was honoured by several marks of esteem by Henry
the Fourth, who at that age discovered extraordinary powers in
the mind of Grotius, but could not help expressing his surprise,
that the States should send a youth <em>without a beard</em> as an assistant
to their ambassador; upon which the stripling astonished the great
Henry by this brilliant reply: “Had my country conceived that
your Majesty measured ability by the length of the beard, they
would have sent in my room a <em>he goat of Norway</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At seventeen he pleaded as a civilian at the bar in his own
country, and was not twenty-four when appointed attorney general.
He escaped from the castle of Louvestein, where he was condemned
to be imprisoned for life, for the share he had in the affairs
which proved the ruin of Barneveldt, in the following interesting
manner: his wife, Maria Van Reygersbergen, who was most tenderly
attached to him, and a lady of great learning and accomplishments,
conciliated the esteem of the wife of the governor of the
castle so far as to obtain permission, during the absence of the
governor one day, to have removed from her husband’s apartment
a large quantity of books, which he had borrowed of a friend at
Gorcum: by the address and excellent management of a servant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>maid, Grotius occupied the place of the books in the trunk; he
was safely conveyed from the castle, not without imminent peril
of being drilled through the body, in consequence of the porters
who carried him down stairs, suspecting that the trunk held a more
learned treasure, than that which it was said to contain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grotius took refuge in France, which he quitted in consequence
of the illiberal conduct of the Cardinal de Richlieu towards him, and
accepted of an invitation from that singular princess Christina, queen
of Sweden, who was greatly attached to him, and made him her
ambassador at Paris, where the Cardinal gave him much trouble,
in consequence of his not yielding precedence to him. When
Grotius had breathed his last, his countrymen felt contrition for
their oppression, and struck a medal in honour of him, on which
he is styled, “The Oracle of Delft, the Phœnix of his Country.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I shall conclude these interesting anecdotes of Grotius, by
giving his excellent sentiments on the education of boys, as he
imparted them to Isaac Vossius, which in my humble opinion
ought to be considered as a treasure to every parent; “Many persons,”
says he, “make use of tutors for the education of their
children, which hardly ever succeeds as it was intended. I have
never approved of that method of education, for I know that young
persons learn only when they are together, and that their application
is languid where there is no emulation. I am as little of a friend to
schools, where the master scarce knows the names of his scholars;
where the number is so great that he cannot distribute his attention
upon each of them, whose composition requires a particular attention.
For these reasons I wish that a medium of the two methods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>were taken, that a master took only ten or twelve boys, who
should live in the same house, and be of the same classes, by which
means the master himself would not be overloaded with cares.”
Grotius also recommends the student to begin with those histories
which are nearest to his own time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fate of Barneveldt is related with great spirit by Voltaire,
who says, But human affairs are ever chequered with good and
evil. Mankind are so apt to deviate from their principles, that
this republic (Holland) had nearly destroyed the liberty for which
she had so bravely fought, and persecution boiled in the blood of a
people, whose happiness and laws were founded on toleration.
Two calvinistical doctors did what so many doctors have done in so
many other places. Gomar and Arminius disputed most furiously
at Leyden, about what neither of them understood. This produced
dissensions in the United Provinces.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dispute was in many respects similar to those of the
Thomists and Scotists, or of the Jansenists and Molinists, concerning
predestination, grace, liberty, and other obscure and frivolous
articles, where they know not how to define the very subject
on which they dispute. The leisure they enjoyed during the truce,
unluckily gave those ignorant people an opportunity to fill their
heads with theological disputes, till at length, out of a scholastic
controversy, there arose two parties in the state. Maurice, Prince
of Orange, headed the Gomarists, and the pensionary Barneveldt
supported the Arminians.</p>

<p class='c007'>Du Maurier says, that he had been told by the ambassador his
father, that Maurice having proposed to the pensionary Barneveldt,
to concur in giving him the supreme power, this zealous republican
showed him the danger and injustice of the proposal, and
<em>from that time Barneveldt’s ruin was resolved upon</em>. This however
is certain, that the Stadtholder endeavoured to increase his authority
by means of the Gomarists, and Barneveldt to check it by
means of the Arminians: that several towns levied soldiers who
were called <em>Expectants</em>, because they expected orders from the
magistrate, but would take none from the Stadtholder: that there
were insurrections in some cities, and that Prince Maurice vigorously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>persecuted the opposite party. At length he convened a calvinistical
council at Dordrecht, composed of all the reformed
churches in Europe, except that of France, the deputies from which
were not permitted by the King of France to attend.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fathers of this synod who had exclaimed so loudly against
the fathers of various councils, and against their authority, condemned
the Arminians, just as they themselves had been condemned
by the council of Trent. Above a hundred Arminian
ministers were banished from the United Provinces. Prince Maurice
chose twenty-six commissioners from the nobility and the
magistrates, to try the grand pensionary Barneveldt, the celebrated
Grotius, and some others of the Arminian party. They had been
kept six months in confinement, previous to their trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the chief motives of the revolt of the Seven Provinces,
and of the house of Orange, against Spain, was the Duke of Alva’s
severity, in suffering the accused to languish for a long period
in confinement, without bringing them to trial, and in appointing
commissioners to condemn them. The same grievances which had
caused such complaints under the Spanish monarchy, were revived
in the bosom of liberty. Barneveldt was beheaded at the
Hague, more unjustly than Count Egmont, and Count Horn at
Brussels. He was an old man of <em>seventy</em>, who had served the Republic
<em>forty</em> years in the cabinet, with as much success as Maurice
and his brothers had served her in the field. The sentence imported,
“<em>That he had done all he could to vex the Church of God</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A charming anecdote is related of the admirable conduct of
the widow of Barneveldt. After he had perished on the scaffold,
his sons, René and William, entered into a conspiracy to revenge
his death, in which they were discovered. William fled, but René
was taken and condemned to die. His mother solicited his pardon
of Prince Maurice, who replied, “It appears strange that you do
that for your son, which you refused to do for your husband;” to
which she nobly replied, “I did not ask pardon for my husband,
because he was innocent; I ask it for my son, because he is guilty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The view from the steeple of this church is esteemed the most
beautiful in Holland, and is remarkable fine and extensive; but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>beauty of the scenery is principally <em>at a distance</em>, as the land immediately
surrounding the town is boggy, dotted with piles of
white turf. The chimes of this church, or as they are called, the
Carillons, are very numerous, consisting of four or five hundred
bells, which are celebrated for the sweetness of their tones. This
species of music is entirely of Dutch origin, and in Holland and
the countries that formerly belonged to her, it can only be heard
in great perfection. The French and Italians have never imitated
the Dutch in this taste; we have made the attempt in some of our
churches, but in such a miserably bungling manner, that the nerves
of even a Dutch skipper would scarcely be able to endure it.</p>

<p class='c007'>These carillons are played upon by means of a kind of keys
communicating with the bells, as those of the piano forte and
organ do with strings and pipes, by a person called the Carilloneur,
who is regularly instructed in the science, the labor of the
practical part of which is very severe, he being almost always obliged
to perform in his shirt with his collar unbuttoned, and generally
forced by exertion into a profuse perspiration, some of the
keys requiring a two pound weight to depress them: after the
performance, the Carilloneur is frequently obliged immediately to
go to bed: by pedals communicating with the great bells, he is
enabled with his feet to play the base to several sprightly and even
difficult airs, which he performs with both his hands upon the upper
species of keys, which are projecting sticks, wide enough
asunder to be struck with violence and celerity by either of the
two hands edgeways, without the danger of hitting the adjoining
keys. The player uses a thick leather covering for the little finger
of each hand, to prevent the excessive pain which the violence of
the stroke, necessary to produce sufficient sound, requires: these
musicians are very dextrous, and will play pieces in three parts,
producing the first and second treble with the two hands on the upper
set of keys, and the base as before described. By this invention a
whole town is entertained in every quarter of it; that spirit of industry
which pervades the kingdom, no doubt originally suggested
this sudorific mode of amusing a large population, without
making it necessary for them to quit their avocations one moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>to enjoy them. They have often sounded to my ear, at a distance,
like the sounds of a very sweet hand-organ; but the want of something
to stop the vibration of each bell, to prevent the notes of one
passage from running into another, is a desideratum which would
render this sort of music still more highly delightful. Holland is
the only country I have been in, where the sound of bells was gratifying.
The dismal tone of our own on solemn occasions, and the
horrible indiscriminate clashing of the bells of the Greek church
in Russia, are, at least to my ear, intolerable nuisances. I afterwards
learnt that the carillons at Amsterdam have three octaves,
with all the semi-tones complete on the manual, and two octaves
in the pedals; each key for the natural sound projects near a foot,
and those for the flats and sharps, which are played several inches
higher, only half as much. The British army was equally surprised
and gratified, by hearing upon the carillons of the principal
church at Alkmaar, their favorite air of “God save the king”
played in a masterly manner, when they entered that town.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this church is a superb monument raised to the memory of
William the First, the great Prince of Orange, in the east end of
the church, which is semicircular, and a range of semicircular
pillars support the roof: within these pillars is a large space railed
off, and paved with black and white marble, under which is the
family vault of the House of Orange; in the centre is the monument,
a sarcophagus on which is placed a marble figure of the
above prince, in his robes after death: at his feet is a dog, the expression
of whose countenance is very much admired; above is a
marble canopy supported by four buttresses of white marble, and
twenty columns of black and gold in fine style: the epitaph, in
small obscure characters, is inscribed upon a tablet held up by two
boys in bronze, and at each corner of the tomb stands a bronze
figure, the first representing Liberty with a cap, inscribed with
<i><span lang="la">aurea libertas</span></i>; the second is Fortitude, the third Religion, and the
fourth Justice, not blind, but ardently gazing upon the balance in
her hand. Under an arch at the head of the tomb is a bronze statue
of the same prince, and at the other end a figure of Fame just
taking wing. The other internal parts of this edifice are adorned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>with the usual mortuary decorations in Holland, long sable lines of
escutcheons. I am as little fond of describing, as I am sure my reader
must be of reading, minute descriptions of monuments; but I have
been particular here, because the Dutch, with their accustomed
frugality, do not much indulge in mausoleums and statues. In
France, the late revolution, in its savage phrenzy, with hands still
reeking with the blood of the dying, tore open the tombs of princes,
and their favourites, and disfigured the consecrated depositaries
with the shattered fragments of their marble mausoleums: that revolution,
which, with the guillotine in front, and the broken cross
in the rear, threatened to spread over and waste the whole of civilized
Europe, marched to Holland, where thousands flocked to its
standard; but it there very rarely inebriated the mind, and never
overpowered the national love of economy; it taught them to despise
and expel their living princes, but with pious frugality they
spared the costly asylums of their illustrious dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is but just to state, however, that, during their political
change, many of the people displayed great firmness, and none
more than the manufacturers of this town, who in the year 1803
presented to the executive government of the Batavian republic, a
very spirited remonstrance against the temporary suspension of an
edict passed in 1802, prohibiting the importation of foreign manufactures
of which the following is an extract: “Should we be left
destitute,” said they, “of that just and lawful support, which we
still hope to obtain, we shall be compelled to demand, that the
laws which forbid the exportation of manufacturing tools and implements
be repealed, in order that we may be enabled to sell our
valuable tools and implements, which will then become altogether
useless to us, to foreigners who know how to appreciate their value,
or to transplant our manufactories into countries where they
daily experience the encouragement which they so highly deserve.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Not far from the old church, the tower of which is alarmingly
out of its perpendicular, is the identical house in which William
I. was murdered by a bigoted hireling of the King of Spain in
1584. A Dutch inscription, placed over two holes in the wall on
the stairs, made by the pistol bullets after they had passed through
his body, communicates the savage circumstance. The bigots of
Spain celebrated the murderer as a martyr, and his family were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>ennobled and pensioned. A solitary instance of honours being paid
to a regicide. Well has our immortal bard observed:</p>

<p class='c007'>The old church had not sufficient attractions to induce me to
enter it. The tombs of Admirals Tromp and Heine are there.
Opposite the new church, in the great square, is the Stadt or
Town House, the front of which is extensive, and very curious:
in this house are some excellent pictures by Frank Hals, who died
in 1666: this artist is justly celebrated for the beauties of his colouring
and penciling. A pleasant anecdote is related of Vandyke’s
having so high an opinion of the genius of this artist, that he went
to Haarlem, where Hals lived, for the sole purpose of visiting him,
and introduced himself as a gentleman on his travels, who had but
two hours to spare, and wished in that time to have his portrait
painted: Hals, who was enjoying his bottle at a tavern at the time,
sprang from his companions, and on the first canvass he could lay
his hands upon, commenced the portrait with all possible celerity;
after he had proceeded some way, Vandyke desired to look at his
progress, and observed, with great pleasantry in his countenance,
that the work seemed to be so very easy, that he thought he could
do the same: upon which he took up the palette and pencils,
requested Hals to sit down, and painted his portrait in a <em>quarter of
an hour</em>: the moment Hals saw it, he exclaimed with rapturous
astonishment, “No one but Vandyke could have achieved such
a wonder!” and embraced him with transport. Vandyke was desirous
of Hals accompanying him to England, where he promised
to make his fortune, but he declared that the enjoyment of his <em>bottle</em>
and his <em>friend</em> was too powerful to permit him to accept of so generous
and promising a proposal. Of this great painter Vandyke
said, that he would have been unequalled had he given more tenderness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>to his colouring, and that in his pencil he was without a
rival.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the council chamber there is a fine composition by Bronchorst,
who died 1661, representing the judgment of Solomon,
and another of Christ driving the money changers out of the
temple; the figures are finely finished, and the architecture, in
which he excelled, truly admirable. In the great hall of the physicians
and surgeons is a celebrated picture by Cornelius de Morn
or Maan, who was born in this town, and who died 1706: the
subject of it is a representation of the most celebrated doctors and
surgeons of his time: it is in the manner of Titian, and in high
estimation. Michael Jansen Mirevelt, who died in 1641, was also
born in this town: he was an admirable portrait painter, and is said
to have been in such high repute, and so indefatigable, that Sandrart,
Descampe, and the authors of the <cite><span lang="fr">Abrégé de la Vie des Peintres</span></cite>
assert, that he painted at least <em>ten thousand</em> portraits, for the smallest
of which he never received less than one hundred and fifty
guilders, or fifteen pounds. In the surgeons’ hall there is a fine
picture by this artist.</p>

<p class='c007'>This town has produced also a self-taught poet, who flourished
rather more than a century since, of the name of Hubert Noot.
This man, who is said to be the father of Dutch pastoral and elegiac
poetry, much resembles our Bloomfield in his early difficulties
and his talents: he made his verses whilst he laboured, and committed
them to memory from not being able to write. After he
had taught himself to read, he even sold his wearing apparel to
purchase books. He died in 1733: his images are said to be highly
poetical, and his versification melodious.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Spin-house, or Bridewell, were several female prisoners,
many of whom had been confined for several years, for respecting
the genial laws of <em>nature</em> more than the sober laws of the
nation, and some of them, for the same offence, had been publicly
and severely flogged. What a contradiction in this government
does its <em>Spin</em> and its <em>Spill-houses</em> present! In one place it sanctions
prostitutes, and in the other imprisons and scourges them! Perhaps
the legislature may think that it punishes the poor prostitute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>of the spill-house, by the oppression of her creditor and her
gaoler; and thus, by Justice presenting a variety of shapes, she
realizes the remark of our divine bard;</p>

<p class='c007'>The stranger will find nothing to detain him in this melancholy
town long. In Holland every traveller naturally becomes amphibious:
the constant contemplation of so much water quickly
engenders all the inclinations of a webfooted animal, and he soon
feels out of his proper element when out of a canal. Right merrily
did I follow my commissionary and his wheel barrow with my
baggage through the whole town, until I reached the Hague gate,
when my favourite conveyance, the treckschuyt, was ready to
start. The boat-bell rung, all the party got on board, and away we
glided, passing on each side of us the most lovely <em>close</em> scenery.
Instead of seeing, as had been represented to me in England, a dull
monotonous scene of green canals, stunted willows, and from a
solitary house or two, <em>foggy</em> merchants stupidly gazing in fixed
attention upon <em>frog</em> water, the canal was enlivened with boats of
pleasure and traffic continually passing and repassing, the noble
level road on the right, broad enough to admit four or five carriages
abreast, thickly planted with rows of fine elms, the number of
curricles and carriages, and horses, driving close to the margin
of the water, the fine woods, beautiful gardens, country-houses, not
two of which were similiar; the eccentricity of the little summer
temples hanging over the edges of the canal; the occasional views
of rich pasture land, seen as I saw them, under a rich, warm sky,
formed a <i><span lang="fr">tout ensemble</span></i> as delightful as it was novel, and very intelligibly
expressed our approach to the residence of sovereignty.
The single ride from Delft to the Hague would alone have repaid
the trouble and occasional anxiety I experienced in getting into,
and afterwards out of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>All the principal country-houses have a wooden letter-box
standing upon the margin of the canal, into which one of the
boatmen, upon the treckschuyt being steered close to the adjoining
bank, without stopping, drops the letters and parcels directed to
the family residing there. In no part of the continent is social intercourse
and communication so frequent, cheap, and certain.</p>

<p class='c007'>For keeping the dams and roads in repair, turnpikes are established
at proper distances, and the care of their repair is confided
to directors, who are always gentlemen of high respectability, and
receive a fixed salary for their services. The principal roads are
kept in good condition; and, on account of the flatness of the country,
are very easy for the horses, but the bye roads are intolerably
bad.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the steerage I found three very handsome and well-bred
Dutch young ladies seated, one of whom spoke English very well:
they all insisted upon my being an Englishman the moment I entered
the boat; how they could think so, the spirit of physiognomy,
if there be such a spirit, must explain; for in my best hours of
health and delight, John Bull would scarcely acknowledge me for
one of his family.</p>

<p class='c007'>My charming companions talked much of Shakspeare and
Milton, with both of whom they seemed to be familiar. They entered
with much ability on Desdemona’s wish, alluding to her
passion for Othello, “that Heaven had made her such a man.”
Two of the three fair disputants contended that she would have been
more happy had Providence made her a man, and such a man as
Othello; the other observed that was impossible, for as she was
deeply in love with the Moor it would have been irreconcileable to
her passion to wish to be of his own sex, by which she could have felt
only friendship for him. I was so pleased with my fair voyageurs,
who talked, sung, and laughed, with so much talent, taste, and vivacity,
that our two hours or six miles, the distance from Delft to
the Hague passed rapidly away, and tempted me not to quit
the vessel to visit the village of Ryswick, which lies about half
way, and is only about half a mile from the canal, and, I am told,
abounds with beauty and richness of scenery. It is known to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>political world for the celebrated peace concluded there at a little
palace of William III. called the House of Neubeurg, after a nine
years’ war, on the 20th September, 1697, between Louis XIV.
and the confederate powers, called the Treaty of Ryswick. I mention
this as a guide for strangers who may follow me, and who
may not be fascinated as I was by my situation in the boat and
content with the highly cultivated and embellished scenery around
me. A man must be in bad humour with nature indeed, who can
pass, in the summer, from Delft to the Hague without emotions
of strong delight.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we approached the Hague, the scenery became more refined
and beautiful, and the last light of a setting sun purpled the
lofty edifices of that celebrated city; it was quite dusk as we passed
the water-houses, in which the royal yachts are contained, the
rich gilded carving of which was just visible through the grated
doors; and after gliding along the suburbs, which were well lighted
though not in this respect comparable with London, I disembarked,
bade adieu to my charming companions, and proceeded
with my usual attendant, through the greater part of the city to
the Mareschal de Turenne, an excellent hotel, but at a most inconvenient
distance from the place where the Delft boats stop, and
where those for Leyden or Haarlem start from.</p>

<p class='c007'>The morning after my arrival there was a grand review of the
Dutch troops, who presented a very soldierly appearance; that of
the body-guard, both horse and infantry, was very superb in military
appointments. I was well informed that the king felt so secure
in his government, that there were not at this time twenty French
soldiers in the country, and that, accompanied by his queen, he
was attending to his health at the waters of Wisbaden, in the
south of Germany. The French interest, however, was predominant,
and it was indispensably necessary that the passport of every
foreigner should be countersigned by the French consul, whose
fiat upon all such occasions was final.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king had been at the Hague, or rather at his palace in the
wood adjoining, only about six weeks, in the course of which, I
was credibly informed, he had displayed uncommon activity and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>talent in the discharge of the great duties of his station. Although
an invalid, he was at his bureau with his ministers every morning
at six o’clock, which he never quitted until the business of the day
was completed. The poor-laws occupied much of his attention,
and they are, I hear, to undergo a considerable amelioration. I
have already mentioned his abolition of useless offices, sinecures,
and unmerited pensions, the reduction of excessive salaries, and
an extension of the time devoted to the service of the state in the
public offices. These advantages could only be expected to flow
from that vast power which revolutions, after their effervescence
has subsided, generally deposit with some fortunate individual,
who, if he has talent and good inclination, is enabled to consult the
prosperity of a state, by measures at once prompt, summary, and
efficacious, unretarded by forms, clashing interests, or hoary prejudices.
The first of the new has ever this advantage over the last
of an old dynasty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hereditary successor of a long line of princes is like the
owner of an ancient mansion devolved to him by hereditary right;
he must take the edifice as it is, with its commodious and inconvenient
chambers, its fantastic turrets and heavy chimney-pieces,
its dark and its cheerful passages; or if he alters, it must be with
a cautious and gentle hand, otherwise the whole fabric will fall
about his ears; whilst he who is elevated by revolutions to command,
may choose his ground, build wholly with new, or partly
with the old materials of the prostrate constitution.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to appreciate the present constitution, it may be necessary
to take a slight review of the old one. Anterior to 1747
the United Provinces subsisted in one common confederacy, yet
each province had an internal government or constitution, wholly
independent of the others, called the States of such a Province,
and its delegates the <em>States General</em>, in whom the supreme sovereignty
of the whole confederacy was lodged; and notwithstanding
the number of delegates which a province might send, yet in every
constitutional measure each province had only one voice, and the
sanction of <em>every province</em>, and of <em>every city within it</em>, was necessary
before such a measure could pass into a law, and every resolution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>of the states of a particular province required unanimous
adoption. The <em>Council of State</em> consisted also of deputies from the
several provinces, but differed in its constitution from the States
General; it was composed of twelve persons, of whom Holland
sent three; Guelderland, two; Zealand, two; Utrecht, two; Friesland,
one; Overyssel, one; and Groningen, one. Such deputies
could only vote personally: it was their department to prepare
estimates, and ways and means, &#38;c. to be submitted to the States
General. The states of the provinces, were styled “Noble and
Mighty Lords;” those of Holland, “Noble and most Mighty
Lords;” and the States General, “High and Mighty Lords,” or
“the Lords of the States General of the United Netherlands,” or
“their High Mightinesses.” Queen Elizabeth called them in her
time <em>Messieurs the States</em>. The Chamber of Accounts, in which
all the public accounts were audited, and composed of provincial
deputies, was placed under these two bodies. The executive part
of the Admiralty was committed to five colleges, in the three
maritime provinces of Holland, Zealand and Friesland. In Holland
the people were excluded from choosing their representatives
or magistrates. In Amsterdam, which had precedence in all public
deliberations, the magistracy was lodged in thirty-six senators chosen
for life, and every vacancy filled up by the survivors, and the
representatives for the cities in the province of Holland, were
elected by the same senate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a complicated piece of machinery must have proceeded
slowly if it proceeded regularly, and must have been constantly
exposed to the peril of being disordered, without a principal head
to guide it, which led to the stadtholdership becoming hereditary
in the year 1747. The wonderful and constant vicissitudes to which
Holland has been exposed, rendered such an expedient, however,
objectionable; it afterwards proved to be in many instances necessary
to the preservation of the country. The history of the republic
for 147 years, namely, from its first entering the field of battle
in 1566 to the peace of Utrecht in 1713, is a tissue of battles lost
and won. The twelve years’ truce which produced an hiatus in her
many wars with Spain, did not extend to the Indian possessions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>of the Dutch; and after a prodigal effusion of blood, the peace obtained
in 1648 lasted only four years. The first war with Great
Britain continued to 1654; and scarcely had the republic tasted of
the sweets of peace before she was roused to resist at the same
time the arms of Portugal, Denmark, and Sweden; and in the
North their hostilities continued till 1660, and in the South to
1661: then immediately followed a fierce contest with Great Britain,
which did not close till the treaty at Breda in 1667, and the
moment that was concluded, the country was invaded by Louis
the Fourteenth.</p>

<p class='c007'>A respite of three years followed, when the republic was unexpectedly
attacked by the united forces of England and France,
both on the sea and shore; and after a carnage of six years more,
the peace of Nimeguen was concluded in 1678; which, however,
was fettered with several severe stipulations imposed by the French
monarch. In 1688 the Prince of Orange sailed for England, to
occupy its vacant throne; an event which involved the Dutch in a
nine years’ war: the peace of Ryswick was scarcely signed, when
the Spanish succession again called them forth to arms, which
they did not lay down till after a slaughter of eleven years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The peace of Utrecht gave them a slight repose, which was
frequently disturbed by the insults and predatory attacks of the
African corsairs upon the Dutch flag in the Mediterranean. The
internal troubles of the republic, from its revolution, and its final
submission to the French arms followed. Such is the brief history
of a country which, in a political and physical view, may be truly
called extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first princes of the House of Orange, by the illustrious
services which they rendered the state by their wars and negotiations,
were rewarded by its confidence and employments of the
highest dignity and trust, which were conferred upon them by the
grateful approbation and concurrence of the most rigid republicans.</p>

<p class='c007'>These princes, in obedience to that law of nature which seems
to be pretty equally predominant amongst all her sons, extended
the power they enjoyed as often as they had the means, and what
they gave to themselves was taken from the liberties of the people;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>but they dazzled the eyes of the subject, and concealed the encroachment,
or legitimated it by the brilliancy of illustrious achievements.
A small territory, scooped from the ocean, rose to rank and estimation
in the scale of nations, by its valour, its riches, and its arts,
and was enabled to resist the mighty power of England and France,
by the genius and energy of succession of five princes of the
House of Orange, for upwards of a century.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stadtholderate remained vacant from the death of William
the Third, who by his talents preserved the republic from impending
danger, till fresh difficulties, the wishes of the nation, and
the powerful interposition of George the Second, in 1747, induced
them to confer the dignity of stadtholder on William the Fourth,
father of the last stadtholder, and to make it hereditary in his family.
This prince (I mean the father) possessed considerable
talents, from which the country did not derive much advantage,
for he died soon after his elevation to the dignity. By this act the
offices of captain-general and admiral-general were united in the
person of the stadtholder, who also became president of every
province; and his power and influence was such as to enable him
to change every deputy, magistrate, and officer, in every province
and city, at pleasure, by which he had the almost complete formation
of the States General, although he had no voice in it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The authority described in the last chapter, so princely and
powerful, in all human probability would have continued in the
family of the prince upon whom it was conferred to this hour, and
descended to their posterity, had the last stadtholder possessed the
virtue, spirit, and wisdom of his ancestors: but the imbecility of
his character, more than those wonderful events which were agitating
other portions of Europe, was the principal cause of the
overthrow of his house. Without any portion of ability, William
the Fifth was alive only to his own aggrandizement and depraved
pleasures. The attachment which he had been taught to cherish for
the politics of England, had long marked him out as an object of
hatred with the Dutch: under his auspices they saw their own
trade deteriorated, and the ocean covered with the commercial
vessels of the British empire, wafting wealth into her ports from
every quarter of the globe, the resources and energies of the republic
consuming without any attempt to resuscitate them, until at
length his weak and culpable conduct closed in the conquest of the
country, and the precipitate retreat of himself and family. The
conduct of the Princess of Orange also contributed not a little to
augment the displeasure of the people. She had that influence
over him which strong minds always have over weak ones, but in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>no instance were her counsels advantageous to the state, and she
had no one quality to conciliate the lower classes of the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the troubles of 1787, she created uncommon disgust
by answering in her own name an address of the States General
to the prince her husband, when she had no recognised character
in the republic, and consequently no right whatever to interfere in
its affairs. Amongst other acts of presumption in the same year,
so memorable in the Dutch annals, when the Orange party, supported
by Prussia, and Great Britain, acquired the ascendency, she
managed the negotiations between the Duke of Brunswick, who
commanded the Prussian army, and the city of Amsterdam, in the
course of which she declared in a tone of angry insolence, that the
generosity of her disposition induced her to spare the lives of the
guilty, but that they should be held incapable of discharging the
duties of any public trust in future. Among the persons whom she
caused to be dismissed were several distinguished and popular
citizens, the survivors of whom were, upon the overthrow of the
house of Orange, called to participate in the government of the
country with the most flattering marks of congratulation.</p>

<p class='c007'>This princess I know has had her admirers, she has been extolled
for her spirit, and capaciousness of mind; but upon almost
every occasion her talents were misapplied, and only served to
augment the storm that burst over and laid the glory of her house
prostrate. What was to close a reign (if such it may be called), so
characterized by weakness and disaster, required not the spirit of
a prophet to foretel. The French revolution found an unembarrassed
introduction into Holland, and the feeble resistance which
the Dutch troops opposed to the French armies, pretty clearly demonstrates
the estimation in which the country held its unworthy
ruler, and the desire they had of delivering themselves from him
and the influence of England upon their councils. It is well known,
that in the last war, the Dutch refused the sick and wounded of
their allies, the British army, admission into Delft, and a body of
burghers was formed at Amsterdam, to prevent the entrance of
foreign troops; in other words, <em>the English</em>, into that city. In his
last struggles the Stadtholder obtained a plenary power, resembling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>that of a dictator, a short time before the French army crossed the
Waal, an event that decided the fate of Holland. Aukwardly
clothed with this vast authority, he issued a proclamation, invoking
the people to rise <i><span lang="fr">en masse</span></i> to oppose their invaders: in obedience
to the invocation, the Dutch army was strengthened by the accession
of about <em>fifty recruits</em>. An order then followed, that throughout
the United Provinces three houses should furnish one man for the
defence of the state, the order experienced a worse fate than the
proclamation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The public antipathy to the Stadtholder and his government
was now raised to its highest elevation: the French entered the
country in triumph, and the flight of the Prince of Orange was
received with enthusiastic expressions of exultation. On the 16th
of February, 1795, a solemn assembly of the deputies from all the
provinces was held at the Hague, at which meeting the stadtholderate
was formally declared to be abolished for ever, and in the
evening of that day a grand republican festival was celebrated, at
which the Dutch legislators, the French representatives, and the
chiefs of the army assisted. When the British troops afterwards
landed at the Helder, they found the sense of the people still the
same. It was not the dread of the revenge of the French army,
that induced them to observe such marked and unequivocal disinclination
to co-operate with a force which professed to have in
view the achievement of salutary objects for their benefit, but the
unextinguishable abhorrence in which they held the house of Orange,
in whose name the English army endeavoured to wrest the country
from the arms of France; and, I believe, since the death of the
son of the Stadtholder, a young prince of great promise, that
throughout the kingdom scarcely one partizan for the house of
Orange is to be found.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fate of Holland is a memorable lesson to other nations.
We wonder that the power of France rolls on with overwhelming
fury: the military observer traces her resistless march to her brilliant
improvements in modern warfare; the politician to the magnitude,
energy, and endless reinforcements of her troops; the superstitious
to her good fortune, and the moralist to the divine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>interposition to rebuke the vices of her enemies. They forget, or
will not see, that the victories of France have hitherto been the
triumph of genius, promptitude, and energy, over ignorance, procrastination,
and supineness: of vigorous over weak councils; of
able, experienced, and faithful, over hereditary, senseless, and perfidious
commanders. These are the causes that made Austria bow
her neck to the chief of the French empire, and in ten days offered
up Prussia to the manes of Poland, in memorable expiation of the
horrors perpetrated in that devoted country in 1771. In the glorious
triumphs of the British flag upon the ocean, we saw great yielding
to greater skill: in Egypt and Media we beheld indisputable
heroism yielding to superior intrepidity, directed by great military
skill, and united to high national honour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The moderation and mildness which characterized the conduct
of the French, rendered them popular by a comparison with the
rigorous folly of the Stadtholder in the last convulsions of his expiring
power. The French checked and kept in complete awe
some of the most illiterate and most depraved of the Dutch republicans
who were preparing to avenge the long and galling triumph
of their adversaries, with sharp and sanguinary resentment; not a
drop of blood was judicially shed upon the overthrow of the ancient
government of the United Provinces, although it had endured for
two centuries; and the pensioners of the house of Orange, whose
stipends were the rewards of meritorious services, received, and
continue to receive, their salaries with generous punctuality, without
being obliged to take an oath of hatred to the Stadtholder, as
other persons who lived by the bounty of the republic were obliged
to do. After Bonaparte had assumed the imperial purple of
France, and determined upon creating a dynasty of sovereigns in
his own family, he prepared the Dutch for the conversion of their
republic into a kingdom, and the reception of a king.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 9th of June, 1806, Messrs. Verhuel and Van Styrum
returned from Paris. His Excellency M. Verhuel, after paying a
visit to the acting pensionary, held conferences with the secretaries
of state, and opened the special mission entrusted to him by
his Imperial Highness Prince Louis Napoleon, as King of Holland,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>as the result of several resolutions for the organization of the
government and communicating, that his majesty the king had
appointed M. Verhuel minister of the marine, and M. Gogel,
minister of finance; the other secretaries of state being charged
to continue in their posts till the king’s arrival.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same gentleman repaired in person to the assembly of
their High Mightinesses, where also, in pursuance of his commission,
he expressed his majesty’s desire, and made the necessary
communications; he also proceeded to the council of state; after
which his excellency assumed the executive power, in the name,
and by the authority of his majesty, whilst the pensionary, who
had acted <i><span lang="la">ad interim</span></i>, resigned that post, and resumed that of president
of their High Mightinesses. The following is the new constitution
which has been digested and promulgated for the Dutch
nation. I have given it rather at length, that the reader may be in
possession of the principal branches of so important and interesting
a document.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Louis Napoleon</span>, by the grace of God and the constitutional laws
of the state, to all whom these presents shall come, sends greeting. Be
it known to all, that we have accepted, and do accept, with the approbation
of his majesty the Emperor Napoleon, our august brother, the dignity
of King of Holland, conformably to the wishes of the country, the constitutional
laws, and to the treaty which, being protected by reciprocal
ratifications, has been this day presented to us by the deputies of the
Dutch nation. Upon our accession to the throne, our dearest care shall be
to watch over the interests of our people. We will always study to give
them constant and multiplied proofs of our love and solicitude (supporting
for those ends) the liberty of all our subjects, as well as their rights, and
in employing ourselves incessantly for their welfare. The independence of
the kingdom is guaranteed by his majesty the emperor and king. The
constitutional laws, and our firm and resolute good will, equally secure to
every one his credit with the state, his personal liberty, and the liberty
of conscience. It is after this declaration that we have decreed, and do

president of their high mightinesses, and shall remain in office in this

<p class='c017'>His imperial and royal Majesty Napoleon, emperor of the French and
king of Italy, and the assembly of their high mightinesses representing
the Batavian republic, president, his excellency the grand pensionary,
accompanied by the council of state and the ministers and secretary of
state.</p>

<p class='c014'>In consideration, 1. That, seeing the general disposition of minds, and
the actual organization of Europe, a government without consistency, and
without a certain duration, cannot fulfil the end of its institution.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. That the periodical renewal of the chief of the state will always in
Holland be a source of dissensions, and out of it, a constant subject of
agitation and discord between the powers either friends or enemies of
Holland.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. That an hereditary government alone can guarantee the quiet possession
of all that is dear to the Dutch people, the free exercise of their
religion, the preservation of their laws, their political independence, and
their civil liberty.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. That their greatest interest is to secure to themselves a powerful
protection, under whose shelter they may freely exercise their industry,
and maintain themselves in the possession of their territory, their commerce,
and their colonies.</p>

<p class='c014'>5. That France is essentially interested in the happiness of the Dutch
people, in the prosperity of their state, and the stability of their institutions,
as much in consideration of the northern frontiers of the empire,
which are open and unprovided with fortified places, as of the principles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>and interests of general policy, have named for plenipotentiary ministers,
viz. his majesty the Emperor of the French and King of Italy, M. C. M.
Talleyrand, grand chamberlain, minister of foreign affairs, great cordon
of the legion of honour, knight of the orders of the red and black eagle
of Prussia, and of the order of St. Hubert, &#38;c.; and the Grand Pensionary,
M. M. C. H. Verhuel, vice admiral, minister of the marine of the Batavian
republic, decorated with the great eagle of the legion of honour; J.
J. A. Gogel, minister of finance; S. Van Styrum, member of the assembly
of their high mightinesses; William Six, member of the council of
state; and G. de Brantzen, plenipotentiary minister of the Batavian republic,
by his imperial and royal majesty decorated with the grand eagle
of the legion of honour, who, after having exchanged their full powers,
have agreed upon as follows.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Art.</span> 1. His majesty the emperor of the French and king of Italy, as
well for himself, his heirs and successors for ever, guarantees to Holland
the maintenance of its constitutional rights, its independence, the entirety
of its possessions in the two hemispheres, its political, civil, and
religious liberty, as it is consecrated by the actual established laws, and
the abolition of all privileges in matters of taxes.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. Upon the formal demand of their high mightinesses, representing
the Batavian republic, that the Prince Louis Napoleon be named and
crowned hereditary and constitutional king of Holland, his majesty, with
deference to this desire, authorises the Prince Louis Napoleon to accept
the crown of Holland to be possessed by him and his natural and legitimate
male descendants, according to priority of birth, to the <em>perpetual exclusion
of females and their descendants</em>. In consequence of this authority,
Prince Louis Napoleon shall possess this crown under the title of King,
and with all the power and all the authority, which shall be determined by
the constitutional laws that the Emperor Napoleon has provided in the
preceding article; nevertheless, it is enacted <em>that the crowns of France and
Holland can never be re-united on the same head</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. The domain of the crown comprehends, 1. <em>a palace at the Hague</em>,
which is to be destined for the residence of the royal household; 2. the
<em>palace of the Wood</em>; 3. the domain of <em>Soestdyk</em>; 4. a revenue in landed
property of 500,000 florins. The law of the state further assures to the
king an annual sum of 1,500,000 florins of Dutch money, payable by
twelve monthly instalments.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. In case of a minority, the regency shall belong of right to the
queen; and in case there shall be no queen, the French emperor, in his
capacity of perpetual chief of the imperial family, is to name the regent
of the kingdom. He is to choose among the princes of the royal family,
and in default of them, among the nation. The minority of the king is to
end at the age of eighteen.</p>

<p class='c014'>5. The jointure of the queen shall be determined by her marriage contract;
for this time it is settled that the jointure is fixed at the annual
sum of 250,000 florins, which shall be taken from the domain of the
crown. This sum deducted, the half of the remainder of the revenues of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>the crown will serve for the expenses of the maintenance of the house
of the minor king, the other half shall be appropriated to the expenses of
the regency.</p>

<p class='c014'>6. The king of Holland shall be for ever grand dignitary of the empire,
under the title of constable; the functions of this grand dignitary may,
nevertheless, be filled at the will of the emperor of the French, by a
prince vice-constable, when he shall judge proper to create this dignity.</p>

<p class='c014'>7. The members of the reigning house of Holland shall remain personally
subject to the dispositions of the 30th of last March, forming the law
of the imperial family of France.</p>

to the house of the king, can only be conferred on natives.</em></p>

<p class='c014'>9. The arms of the king shall be the ancient arms of Holland quartered,
with the imperial eagle of France, and surmounted with the royal crown.</p>

<p class='c014'>10. There shall be forthwith concluded between the contracting powers,
a treaty of commerce, by virtue of which the subjects of Holland will be
treated at all times in the ports, and on the territory of the French empire,
as the nation especially favored. His majesty the emperor and king,
further engages to intercede with the powers of Barbary, that the Dutch
flag may be respected by them, as well as that of his majesty the emperor
of the French. The ratifications of the present treaty shall be exchanged
at Paris in the space of ten days.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The 20th of June, 1806, his majesty the king of Holland made a proposal
to their high mightinesses, concerning the oaths to be pronounced
by the king and by the public officers, as also of the publication of the
laws: their high mightinesses approved the same day the law, which is
to the following purport:</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Of Oaths.</span></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Art.</span> 1. Immediately after the proclamation, the king will receive the
oath of their high mightinesses, of the ministers the counsellors of the
state, of the high court of justice, of the great and other officers of the
palace, of the national chamber of accounts, of the presidents, of the attorney
general, of the courts of justice, of officers of the land and sea; to
the rank of lieutenant-colonel and captain; lieutenant inclusively.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. In the course of this year, the king, accompanied by his ministers,
the great officers, and the officers of the palace, will take the oath to the
Dutch nation, in the presence of their high mightinesses, the council
of the state, of the high court of justice, of the national chamber of accounts,
of the high military court, of the council of taxes and prizes by
sea and land, of the presidents of the departmental administrations, and
of the presidents of the tribunals. The secretary of state to commit to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>writing the verbal process of taking the oath. The oath of the king is conceived
in these terms:</p>

<p class='c014'>“I swear to maintain the constitutional laws of the kingdom, to defend
the integrity of the territory of the kingdom, to respect the liberty
of worships, to respect and to cause to be respected the equality of
rights, as well as the civil, and political liberty: not to raise any taxes,
and to order no impositions but by virtue of the law: to have no other
end in my reign than the sole interests, the prosperity, and the glory of
the Dutch nation.”</p>

<p class='c014'>3. The oath that is made to the king is conceived in these terms:</p>

<p class='c014'>“I swear obedience to the constitutional laws of the kingdom, and
fidelity to the king.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Of the Publication.</span></h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Art.</span> 1. The king will seal and publish all the laws.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. Two copies are to be made of each law, both to be signed by the
king, countersigned by the secretary of state and one of the ministers,
and sealed with the great seal.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. One of the copies is to be deposited among the archives of the secretary
of state, and the other among the archives of their high mightinesses.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. The publication shall be conceived in these terms, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c014'>The minister of the home department has the care of the publication.</p>

<p class='c014'>5. Judgments shall be pronounced, and the execution of them follows
immediately.</p>

<p class='c014'>The court shall execute its judgments in the name of the king. All
civil and military authorities, legally required for the purpose, are bound
to render their assistance.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Royal Decree of the 25th of June, 1806, creating general directors for the different departments of the public administration. </h3>

<p class='c017'>Louis Napoleon, &#38;c. considering, that the affairs of the colonies are
administered by two councils, who have neither strength nor unity sufficient
to act to the advantage of the interests of the kingdom; and that
nevertheless this important branch of the administration of the affairs of
the kingdom merits all our solicitude: considering, that the ministry of
marine is of too high a nature, and that the objects which relate to it are
too multiplied and too abstract to be united with that of the war department:
considering, that the minister for the home department is sufficiently
occupied by the inspection of administration, and the inspection
of the waters; by the cares of promoting the advancement of agriculture;
of the public safety and instruction; and, indeed, of the arts and sciences,
we have decreed as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Art.</span> 1. There shall be three general directors, who shall follow immediately
in rank the ministers, and shall be employed directly with us,
viz. The director general of the war department; the director general of
the affairs of India and of commerce; the director general of affairs relative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>to public worship and justice, and at the same time charged with the
care of all that regards the safety of the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. They shall enjoy the honours, rank, and treatment of ministers.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. Our ministers are respectively charged, as far as they are concerned,
with the execution of the present decree.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Royal Decree of the 1st of July, 1806, containing the Organization and the Attributes of the Council of State. </h3>

<p class='c017'>Louis Napoleon, &#38;c. considering, that the council of state is charged
with high and important functions; that all the laws, and almost all the
acts of administration, ought to be prepared and discussed there: considering,
that amongst these acts there are many of great importance for
the interests and security of the different departments, and which require
the local knowledge of each country, its situation and particular customs:
considering, that there are laws and acts of government of such importance,
that they require the united talents and zeal of all the citizens who
have experience thereon, have decreed, and do decree as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Art.</span> 1. That the council of state shall be composed of thirteen members
residing near us.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. That it shall be formed in a general assembly, and divided into
sections.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. That the general assembly shall be convoked, and presided over
by the king.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. That the ministers shall have rank, a seat, and a deliberative voice
in the council of state.</p>

<p class='c014'>5. That there shall be five divisions of the council of state, each of
which shall have its president.</p>

<p class='c014'>6. These divisions shall be as follows: the division of legislation and
of general affairs, comprehending the affairs of administration, and all
that has not a reference to the other divisions; the division of marine;
of finances; of commerce and the colonies; the division of war. The
president and the members of the divisions or sections shall be appointed
by us every three months. Each section shall have a superior clerk attached
to it.</p>

<p class='c014'>7. The title, rank, and honours of the counsellors of state shall be
granted either to the public officers or to the members of the different
authorities, or to the citizens most distinguished by their talents and
probity. They shall not be annexed to the divisions of the council of state
until they have been called by us to the council.</p>

<p class='c014'>8. There shall always be a counsellor of state of each of the eight great
departments for the legislation and general affairs, another for financial
affairs, and another for the affairs relative to commerce and the colonies;
and this in order that we may be well assured that the laws, or very important
acts of government, shall not be prepared and discussed without
having taken into consideration the situation and interests of each of the
eight grand departments.</p>

<p class='c014'>9. These counsellors of state shall have no other provision than for
such duty as they shall be otherwise called upon to exercise. They shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>have no right to come to the council unless called thither by us. The
counsellors extraordinary of state, who might be nominated members of
the assembly of their high mightinesses, shall not be assembled at the
council of state so long as they shall exercise that dignity.</p>

<p class='c014'>10. On the first of January every year we will determine the list of
the thirteen resident counsellors of state, and of the presidents, in order
to call to a residence near us those who might be in the departments.</p>

<p class='c014'>11. The resident counsellors who shall be preserved on the list will
occupy in the departments the places to which they shall be or might have
been called.</p>

<p class='c014'>12. There shall be a secretary general of the council of state, having
under him the offices necessary for the dispatch of business.</p>

<p class='c014'>13. There shall be near our council of state, Auditors, of whom we
shall determine the number and the distribution. They shall be chosen
from amongst those young men who are destined for the administration,
who have finished their studies, and who have distinguished themselves
therein. There shall be two classes, the first composed of young people
who shall have shewn in the exercise of their functions more capacity,
discretion, and attachment to their duty: they shall take the name of auditors
of the king, and the others merely the name of auditors. They shall
be employed to prepare business, according to the orders they shall receive
from the presidents of the sections of the council of state: they shall
have no communication with the ministers unless by a formal order from
us. The auditors of the king shall assist at the general sittings of the
state when they are called there by us. In that case they shall rank behind
the counsellors of state, and shall have no voice in council, unless
we, from a wish to assure ourselves whether they improve in the transaction
of affairs, in qualifying themselves for the administration, shall ask
their advice: the other auditors shall only be employed in the interior of
the divisions.</p>

<p class='c014'>14. As the institution of auditors is intended to initiate young men in
business, and to facilitate the means of succeeding in it, they will receive
no provision.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Royal Decree of the 9th July, 1806, relative to the Presentation of the projected Laws of their High Mightinesses. </h3>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Art.</span> 1. When the plan of a law, (the council of state having been
heard) shall have been adopted by us, the secretary of state shall summon,
by a letter, the president of the legislative body, at least two days beforehand,
to assemble the orators of the government at such a day and such
an hour, at the assembly of their high mightinesses, to present to them
one or several projects of law; if there are many, the number shall be indicated.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. The secretary of state shall inform the same day the secretary general
of the council of state that such project of law has been adopted by his
majesty; he will transmit to him at the same time a decree, signifying:
1st, the nomination of auditors; 2d, the day of presentation.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>3. On the day appointed for the presentation at the latest, the general
secretary of the council of state shall transmit to the person first named
in the decree, and who is to be the speaker, 1st, a copy of the same decree
by which their powers are constituted; 2d, two copies of the law.</p>

<p class='c014'>6th. The orators of the government shall repair to the assembly of
their high mightinesses, in the carriages of government, preceded by two
tipstaffs and accompanied by two of the royal horse guards. The guards
before whom they pass will draw up, and present their arms: at the palace,
where the sittings of the assembly of their high mightinesses are
held, they are to be received in a private room by the committee of that assembly,
then at the door of the chamber of sittings by the notary, who
shall introduce them to the place of the sittings of the assembly, and accompany
them to the place destined for them, and which is similiar to
that of the members of the assembly. The orator of the government first
named in the decree, shall ask the president for leave to speak, and read,
first, the royal decree and the project of the law, and secondly the exposition
of the motives. This address finished, the president shall return
the act to the orators, and a copy signed, which they are to report,
and the orators will retire with the same ceremony with which they
arrived.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the 7th article of the treaty signed at Paris the 24th of May, 1806,
ordains that the members of the reigning house of Holland shall remain
personally subject to the dispositions of the 30th of last March, forming
the law of the imperial family of France, it cannot but be agreeable to
find here the most important articles to which his majesty the King of
Holland is subjected, and which are most adapted to him: they are as
follows:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Title</span> 1st. Of the Princes and Princesses of the Imperial House.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Art.</span> 1. The emperor is the chief and common father of his family;
under these titles he exercises paternal authority over those who compose
it, during their minority; and preserves always, in respect to them, a
power of inspection, of police, and of discipline, the principal objects of
which will be determined hereafter.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. The imperial house is composed, first, of the princes comprised in
the hereditary order established by the act of the constitutions of the
28th May, 12th year, concerning their marriage, and their descendants
in legitimate marriage: 2d. of the princesses our sisters, of their husbands,
and of their descendants in legitimate marriage, to the fifth degree inclusively:
3dly. of our children by adoption, and of their legitimate descendants.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Title III.</span> Of the Education of the Princes and Princesses of the Imperial House. </h3>

<p class='c017'>26. The emperor regulates all that concerns the issue of the princes
and princesses of this house: he nominates and revokes at will those who
are commissioned with it, and determines the place where it is to be
effected.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>27. All the princes born in hereditary order will be brought up together,
and by the same tutors and officers, either in the palace inhabited
by the emperor, or in another palace within the distance of ten <i><span lang="fr">myriamètres</span></i><a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c021'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
from his usual residence.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f2'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. <i><span lang="fr">Myriamètre</span></i> is equal to 5132 43–100 toises, or 1 7–20 German mil
15 to a degree.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>26. Their course of education will begin at the age of seven, and will
finish at the attainment of the age of sixteen. The children of those who
have distinguished themselves by their services may be admitted to participate
of the advantages.</p>

<p class='c014'>27. Should it happen that a prince in the hereditary order should ascend
a foreign throne, he will be bound, when his male issue should be
seven years old, to send them to the above-mentioned houses to receive
their education.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Of the Presentation of Petitions and Audiences.</span></h3>

<p class='c017'>Those who wish to present petitions, or addresses, &#38;c. to the king,
will put at the head, “To the King.” They all begin with the title of
Sire, and in the body of the addresses, &#38;c. the words “Your Majesty”
must be used. His majesty has provisionally charged the counsellor of
state, M. Golberg, in order to receive in his name all the requests, supplications,
and remonstrances which may be presented, and to give a circumstantial
account of them to the King. This counsellor attends for this
purpose in the apartments of the old court, every Tuesday and Friday,
from nine in the morning till two in the afternoon. But all petitions, supplications,
or remonstrances, must be presented in writing, on stamped
paper: and there ought besides to be indorsed on the petitions, &#38;c. the
name of the supplicant, the nature of the demand, and in concise terms,
the motives of the same. It must be observed besides, that all demands,
addresses, or remonstrances to the courts, or tribunals of justice, departmental
administrations, or other constituted authorities, ought to be sent
to the minister or directors general, that the deed which relates to the
object, be made by them, and presented to the king. Those who desire
to be admitted to the audience of his majesty the king, are obliged to address
themselves for this purpose to the chamberlain of the day, the motive
for which this audience is requested, must be signified by writing,
and the place where the answer may be sent exactly mentioned. The
king has decreed, that in order to facilitate and assure as much as possible
the relation between him and his subjects, all the ministers, or directors
general, have to give once or twice a week a public audience; for this
purpose they have fixed the following days, &#38;c. &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leading features in this constitution, are the guarantee of
the payment of the national debt; the free and unqualified exercise
of religion; the predominant authority vested in the king; the establishment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>of the salique law, for ever excluding females from the
throne; the declaration that the minority of any future king shall expire
upon his attaining his eighteenth year; that only natives shall be
eligible to any offices under the state, exclusive of those immediately
appertaining to the king’s household; that the yearly revenue of the
king shall be two millions of florins, and that the royal residences
shall be the palaces of the Hague, in the Wood, and at Soestdyke.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a few months have only rolled away since the promulgation
of this constitution, it would be somewhat hasty to offer any
objections to it: it must be left to time to ascertain how far it is
adapted to the genius and resources, and propitious to the prosperity
of the people.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Soon after the promulgation of the constitution, the King
and Queen set off from Paris to take possession of their new kingdom,
and on the 23d of June following made their solemn entry
into the Hague: they left the palace in the Wood in the following
order; a herald at arms, his majesty’s horse guards, the guard of
honour, the council of state in three coaches, the admirals in one
coach, the ministers in two coaches, the great officers of the crown
in one coach, their majesties in one coach, the generals in two
coaches: the ladies and officers of the royal household in one coach,
followed by aids-de-camp and other officers, and the whole procession
closed by detachments of hussars and dragoons.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the procession reached the palace of their high mightinesses,
their majesties were received at the door by four deputies
from the assembly. They ascended the great staircase, passed
through the chamber of the national library, and were received at
the door of the anti-chamber by the president of their high mightinesses,
and two other deputies. Having entered the hall of the
assembly, her majesty was conducted to her tribune by two deputies.
The king seated himself on his throne, and put on his hat. On
the right side, and behind his majesty, sat the grand chamberlain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and the aid-de-camp general; on the left, the master of the horse,
and the grand master of the civil list. All the other officers of state
were ranged in proper situations. The members of the assembly
stood up in their places uncovered on the entrance of the king;
but when his majesty covered himself, they followed his example.
The president placed himself in his chair, directly opposite to the
king. After the king was seated on his throne, he directed the grand
master of the ceremonies to administer the oaths of allegiance to
their high mightinesses. The oaths were accordingly first taken by
the president, and afterwards by the other members, in the order of
their seniority. Each member approached to the foot of the throne,
and was sworn on the Holy Evangelists. When all the members
were sworn, his majesty delivered the following speech to the
assembly:</p>

<p class='c022'>“<span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p class='c014'>“When the national deputies came to offer me the throne which I
ascend this day, I accepted it, under the conviction that it was the wish
of the whole nation; that the confidence and the necessities of all called
me to it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Relying on the intelligence, zeal, and patriotism of the principal
public functionaries, and particularly on yours, gentlemen the deputies, I
have fearlessly weighed in my mind the misfortunes of the nation in their
fullest extent. Animated by the strongest desire to promote the welfare
of this good people, and entertaining a hope that I should one day attain
that end, I stifled those sentiments which, till then, had been ever the
object and happiness of my life. I have consented to change my country,
to cease to be solely and entirely a Frenchman, after having passed my
whole life in performing, to the best of my ability, those duties which
that name prescribes to all who have the honor of bearing it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have consented to separate myself, for the first time, from him
who, from my infancy, has possessed my love and admiration: to lose the
repose and independence which those whom Heaven calls to govern cannot
have: to quit him, the separation from whom would fill me with apprehension,
even in the most tranquil times, and whose presence precludes
danger.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have consented to all this, and, gentlemen, had I not done so, I
would nevertheless yet act the same part, now that by the ardour, joy,
and confidence of the people through whose country I have passed, they
have proved to me, that you were the true interpreters of the nation, now
especially, when I am convinced, that I may rely on your zeal, your attachment
to the interests of your native land, and on your confidence in,
and fidelity, towards me.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“Gentlemen, this is the first day of the real independence of the
United Provinces. A transient glance at past ages is sufficient to convince
us, that they never had a stable government, a fixed destiny, a real
independence. Under that famous people, whom they fought and served
by turns, as under the Franks and the Empire of the West, they were
neither free nor tranquil.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Neither were they so afterwards, when subjected to Spain.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Their wars, and their repeated quarrels until the union, added to
the glory of the nation, confirmed its qualities in point of frankness, intrepidity,
and honor, for which, indeed, it had been always celebrated; but
its efforts procured it neither tranquillity nor independence, even under
the Princes of Orange, who, though they were useful to their country, as
soldiers and statesmen, were always disturbing it, by pretending, or endeavouring
to obtain a power which the nation denied them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nor could Holland be considered in that state in later times, when
the elevation of ideas, and the general agitation of Europe, so long suspended
the repose of nations.</p>

<p class='c014'>“After so many vicissitudes, so much agitation, so many calamities;
and at a time when the great states were enlarging themselves, ameliorating
and concentrating their governments and their forces, this country
could enjoy no real safety nor independence, but in a moderate monarchical
state; a form which had been acknowledged during a long period,
and by each nation, in its turn, as the most perfect, and if not absolutely
so, yet as much so as the nature of man will admit. But, doubtless, if
perfection were the lot of humanity, we might then dispense with a government
of this kind. Laws would then be founded in wisdom, and
obeyed without reluctance or obstacle; virtue would reign triumphant,
and insure its own reward; vice would be banished, and wickedness rendered
impotent; but illusions which favour such romantic ideas of human
nature, are transient; and experience soon brings us back to positive
facts.</p>

<p class='c014'>“However, even monarchy itself is not sufficient for a country, which,
though powerful and important, is not sufficiently so for its position,
which requires forces of the first rank both by land and sea. It will, therefore,
be necessary for it to form a connexion with one of the great powers
of Europe, with which its amity may be eternally assured, without any
alteration of its independence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“This, gentlemen, is what your nation has done; this is the object of
its constitutional laws, and also that of my taking upon me an employment
so glorious; this is my object in my placing myself in the midst of a
people, who are, and ever shall be mine, by my affection and solicitude.
With pride I perceive two of the principal means of government and
confidence offering themselves to me; the <em>honour</em> and the <em>virtue</em> of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, gentleman, these shall be real supporters of the throne; I wish
for no other guides. For my part, <em>I know no distinctions of religion or party;
distinctions can only arise from merit and services</em>. My design is only to remedy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>the evils which the country has suffered. The duration of these
evils, and the difficulty of remedying them, will only increase and realize
my glory.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To effect these objects, I have occasion for the entire confidence of
the nation, their complete devotion, and all the talents of the distinguished
men whom it contains, but particularly of you, gentlemen, whose zeal,
talents, and patriotism, are well known.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am at this moment appealing to the good and faithful Hollanders,
before the deputies of the provinces and principal cities of the kingdom.
I see them around me with pleasure. Let them bear to their fellow-citizens
the assurance of my solicitude and affection: let them carry the same
testimony of these sentiments to <em>Amsterdam</em>; that city, which is the honour
of commerce, and of the country: that city, which I wish to <em>call my
good and faithful capital</em>, though the Hague will always remain the residence
of the sovereign. Let them also carry the same assurances to their
fellow-citizens, and the deputies of that neighbouring city, the prosperity
of which I hope very soon to renew, and whose inhabitants I distinguish.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is by these sentiments, gentlemen; it is by the union of all orders
of people in the state, and by that of my subjects among themselves; it is
by the devotion of each individual to his duties, the only basis of real
honour assigned to men; but principally by the unanimity which has hitherto
preserved these provinces from all dangers and calamities, and
which has ever been their shield, that I expect the tranquillity, safety,
and glory of the nation, and the happiness of my life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king has given general satisfaction by the choice he has
made of the persons he has nominated to fill the public offices;
and if the wishes of one who trespassed a little irregularly upon
their shores can avail, the brave, frugal, and indefatigable Hollanders
will derive happiness, and, when peace is restored to Europe,
prosperity under their new government.</p>

<p class='c007'>The revenue attached to the stadtholderate was nominally 18,000<em>l.</em>
per annum; but by the great patronage and influence belonging
to it, no doubt it must have been considerably augmented, as also
by the revenues arising from other hereditary territories of the
stadtholders; but after all, the income of the stadtholderate was
scarcely sufficient to support the dignity of the situation, powerful
and important as it at last became. The king, in addition to his
revenue, has an enormous private fortune: the savings which he
has effected in the state reconcile the Dutch to this liberal, but
perhaps not excessive allowance made for the support of his dignity.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>How the Hague could be called a village, in all its meridian
splendor, is a matter of surprise: it derived its name from s’Cravenhage,
or the Count’s Wood, on account of a wood which formerly
grew here, and which formed, some centuries since, a part of the
domains of the Counts of Holland. The following anecdote will
show the simplicity which reigned in this great and beautiful city
in former times. When Louisa de Coligni was coming to be married
to Prince William at the Hague, the Dutch sent an open
post-waggon to meet her, and she entered the city seated on a
plank: towards the latter end of Prince Maurice’s days, and during
Frederic-Henry’s lifetime, the Hague became a very agreeable
place, and the resort of people of the first distinction.</p>

<p class='c007'>In my rambles round this city, I was much impressed with
the elegance and spaciousness of the buildings; every object
seemed to have partaken of the spirit and magnificence of a court.
But there was a solemnity in the splendor. It reminded one of
looking into a magnificent ball-room after the greater part of the
company had departed, and the lustres were dying away. If the
Orange family had been entitled to sympathy, the scene would have
led me to feel and think for them. Its noble buildings, its spacious
streets, gracefully built, shaded with trees, and divided by canals,
the variety of surrounding scenery, its proximity to the sea, its
elevated situation, and the purity of its air, render the Hague the
most charming town in Holland. The first place I visited was the
palace of the last of the stadtholders. It is a vast pile of houses,
many of them somewhat ancient, surrounded by a canal, without
which and a pipe, paradise itself would have no charms for a
Dutchman: over the canal are several draw-bridges; and the whole
has a very pleasing effect seen from the spot where I took the
view of it. On one side of a quadrangle is part of a new palace,
built by the late stadtholder, and which, had it been finished, would
have been handsome and princely; but the troubles in Holland have
prevented its completion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In part of this building there is a noble gothic hall, much resembling
Westminster-Hall, and very large; on each side little
shops were arranged, similar to those in Exeter ‘Change: it is converting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>into a chapel for the king. There were here formerly the
prince’s cabinet of natural history and museum of rarities, consisting
of a tolerable collection of shells, petrifactions, precious stones,
fossils, minerals, and birds. This collection has been removed to
Paris, although, from all I could learn, scarcely worthy of so much
trouble: it, however, furnished the first elements of knowledge to
Camper, one of the most profound geniuses which the United
Provinces ever produced, and also Professor Pallas, who has been
called the Pliny of Russia. The French offered to re-sell this cabinet
to the Dutch government, who declined becoming the purchasers;
a tolerable proof of its inferiority. The prince’s cabinet of
pictures was very select and valuable, and was enriched by the
productions of Titian, Holbein, Rembrandt, Vandyke, Gerard Dow,
Metzio, Polemburgh, and other illustrious artists. On the confiscation
of the property of the exiled Stadtholder, the Dutch government,
for the purpose of promoting the polite arts, formed
this collection of pictures, esteemed one of the most valuable in
Europe, into a national gallery, set apart an annual sum for the
augmentation of it, and deposited it in a fine suite of apartments
in the House in the Wood, where a director of ability, and assistants,
were appointed to superintend it: but the French soon afterwards
transferred the best of them to that magnificent depot of
the fruits of conquest, the Louvre at Paris. The first person sent
by Napoleon to select for his gallery was unequal to his office, and
left some excellent works behind him, which, upon “a second
shaking of the tree” by another and more able inspector, were
collected, and sent off to that <em>colossal collector</em> of works of art.
Amongst several landscapes by Vernet was the finest he ever
painted, the subject, the waterfall of Tivoli. It is a curious circumstance
that there is not one fine private collection at the Hague.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was much delighted with the Voorhout, considered the principal
street, in which are many elegant and classical buildings, forming
complete contrasts to the leaning, mercantile structures of Rotterdam.
In this street the most elegant houses are those which formerly
belonged to the Prince Wielburgh, who married the last Prince of
Orange’s sister, and to the French ambassador, formerly occupied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>by the British minister: but the most beautiful part of the Hague
is the Vyverburg; it is a vast oblong square, adorned with a noble
walk or mall, strowed with broken shells, and shaded by avenues
of trees on one side, and on the other by the palace, and a large
basin of water called the Vyver, almost a quarter of a mile in
length, variegated by an island of poplars in its centre. This mall
is the place of fashionable resort, and, on the evening of the day I
saw it, was adorned with several groups of lovely women attired
in the French fashion, which generally prevails amongst the genteel
families in Holland. Besides these there are many other very
noble ones, and all remarkably clean, but the canals are almost all
of them green and stagnant, and at this season emitted an unpleasant
effluvia. Here, as in many cities in France, the armorial ensigns
of distinguished families, which used to dignify the front of their
dwellings, have been cut away, and many a shield remains despoiled
of its quarterings. Some of them, since the new order of
things has occurred, have been restored. In a square planted on all
sides with trees the parade is held.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Lady Wortley Montagu, in her accustomed sprightliness
of style, has mentioned with some appearance of disgust, the white
fishy faces of the Dutch women, I beg to observe, that at the
Hague I saw several very pretty females: in general they possessed
transparent delicacy of countenance, but as generally wanted
expression. An English gentleman who had just returned from
Italy, where he had been accustomed for several years to the warm
voluptuous brunettes of that beautiful country, was uncommonly
delighted with the fair faces of the Dutch ladies; but female beauty
does not begin to expand itself till after the imprisonment and
regimen of the nursery are past. Pretty and healthy children are
rarely to be seen in Holland: in general they look pale and squalid,
owing to an abominable system followed in rearing them; they
are accustomed for the first two or three months to respire the
atmosphere of a room, the windows of which are never opened
to receive the freshness of the morning air; to wash them with
refreshing cold water would be considered as certain infanticide;
the miserable infant is swathed round with flannel rollers, until it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>becomes as motionless as a mummy; and over these ligatures there
is always a vast flannel wrapper folded three or four times round the
body, and fastened at the bottom of its feet: afterwards, for many
months it is loaded with woollen garments, and when at length it is
permitted to try for what purpose legs were originally constructed,
it is cased in an additional wrapping of flannel, to prevent the dreaded
consequences of freely inhaling the salubrious air.</p>

<p class='c007'>As it was summer, I can only speak from information of an
equally vile and destructive custom, which obtains in the winter,
of suffering the children to sit over the chauffepies or stoves,
which frequently supplants the ruddy tints of health by a white
parboiled appearance. I saw several of these chauffepies, from
which the little pots that in cold weather contain the burning turf,
had been withdrawn, used by the ladies as footstools. Whilst the
men warm themselves with the smoke of tobacco from above, the
ladies, to recompense themselves for not using that indulgence,
take care to fumigate themselves below, by placing, in the proper
season, these ignited stoves under their petticoats, and resemble
the glow-worm, which carries his fire in his tail: the cats and
kittens, from the genial warmth of the climate, are glad to take
shelter in this warm mysterious sanctuary. The ladies and the
lower classes of females are always remarkably neat about the
feet; the petticoats of the latter are in general very short, display
a well-proportioned leg, clean blue stockings, and a slipper without
any heel-piece, or sabot.</p>

<p class='c007'>In my way to the palace in the Wood, near this square, I
passed by a vast triumphal arch made of wood, painted to imitate
stone, and adorned with a number of complimentary inscriptions
in Latin, in honour of the king and queen, who passed through it
on the 23d of June last, when they made their public entry; and
in a vast field adjoining to the wood was a lofty temporary obelisk
of the same materials, which formed one of the principal objects
of a magnificent fête recently given by the French commander in
chief in honour of their majesties, which was conducted in the
highest style of Parisian taste. The day when I visited the wood
was remarkably fine; this spot, so dear to the Dutch, is nearly two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>English miles long, about three-quarters of a mile broad, and contains
a fine display of magnificent oaks growing in native luxuriance.
Antony Waterloo made the greatest part of his studies from this
spot and its environs. The ground upon which it grows, and the
country about it, undulate a little, a circumstance of agreeable novelty,
and the whole is a truly delightful walk, more romantic and
umbrageous than our mall of St. James’s, and surpassed only by
the garden of the Thuilleries. This wood has been held sacred with
more than pagan piety. War and national want, that seldom spare
in their progress, committed no violations here. Although the favourite
place of royal recreation, yet, in the fury of the revolution,
not a leaf <em>trembled but in the wind</em>. Philip II. in the great war with
Spain, issued his mandate for preserving it: hostile armies have
marched through it without offering it a wound, and the axe of
the woodman has never resounded in it. Even children are taught
or whipt into veneration for it, so that their mischievous hands
never strip it of a bough. Once, however, it is recorded, that at a
period of great state necessity, in 1576, their high mightinesses
sat in judgment upon its noble growth, and doomed it to fall: the
moment their decree was known, the citizens flew to the meeting,
remonstrated with a degree of feeling which did honour to their
taste; and upon learning that the object of its doom was to raise
a certain sum to assist in replenishing the nearly exhausted coffers
of the republic, they immediately entered into a contribution, and
presented the amount to the “high and mighty masters” of the
sacred grove.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been asserted by some travellers, that the Dutch treasure
this spot more from national pride than feeling, and that they are
more disposed to preserve than to enjoy it. To this remark I have
only to offer, that I saw a considerable number of equestrian and
pedestrian groups, who appeared to relish its shaded roads, and
sequestered walks with great delight. The royal residence is to the
right at the end of the wood. Upon my asking a Dutchman which
path led to the “house in the wood,” the only appellation by which,
in the time of the Stadtholder, it was known, he sharply replied,
“I presume you mean the <em>palace</em> in the wood.” This building is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>merely fit for the residence of a country gentleman, and has nothing
princely about it, except the centry boxes at the foot of the
flight of stairs ascending to the grand entrance: two tall and not
very perpendicular poles, from the tops of which is stretched a
cord, suspending in the centre a large lamp, stand on each side of
the house in front of the palace; on the left are the coach-houses
and stablings, which are perfectly plain, and are just separated
from the court road by a small stunted plantation: there was a
very handsome carriage of the king’s in the coach-house, without
arms or cyphers, of a pale blue colour, which, with silver lace, is
the colour of the new royal livery. The carriage had every appearance
of having been built in England. Excepting this, I
never before saw a carriage, unless appropriated for state occasions,
belonging to any crowned head on the continent, that
an Englishman of taste and opulence would be satisfied with.
Even the carriages of Napoleon, built in a city so celebrated
for its taste in design, and beauty of workmanship, as Paris, are
clumsy and unpleasant to the eye. Although it was Sunday, the
sound of workmen, actively engaged in modernizing the palace
after the Parisian taste, issued from almost every window. Some
Dutchmen who were contemplating the front of the house, shook
their heads at this encroachment of the sabbath. In consequence
of the internal arrangement not being finished, strangers were not
admitted. The walks on the outside of the gardens are formal and
insipid; the gardens themselves are handsomely disposed, and
kept in great order, and the whole of the premises is insulated by
stagnant canals crossed with draw-bridges.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this palace, amongst many other precious works of art,
was the celebrated picture of King William the Third, who appointed
the famous Godfrey Scalken, when he was in London, to
paint his portrait by candlelight: the painter placed a taper in
the hands of his majesty, to hold it in a situation most favourable
to the designs of the artist, during which the tallow melted and
dropped on the fingers of the monarch, who endured it with great
composure, for fear of embarrassing the painter, who very tranquilly
continued his work, without offering to pause for a minute:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>it is not much to the credit of the prince of the country to record,
that this blunt enthusiasm for his art lost poor Scalken the favour
of the court, and of persons of fashion, and he retired to the Hague,
where he had a prodigious demand for his small paintings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The furniture of this, which, as well as of the other palaces,
was superb, but old fashioned, was sold by the French, upon the
pretence that their arms were directed against the Prince of
Orange personally. In this palace the Stadtholder and his family
used to indulge his subjects in that ridiculous custom of eating
before them on certain days; a custom which was a fit appendage
to another, that of keeping dwarfs and fools about the royal person.
How this stupid usage came to be adopted at first I know not,
for one would naturally think that the situation least calculated to
inspire awe and veneration, those great supports of royalty,
amongst subjects towards their rulers, would be that in which a
mere animal appetite is gratified. In England such splendid folly
has been long discontinued.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plain manner in which the Prince of Orange and his
family resided at this palace, is thus described by the late ingenious
Mr. Ireland. “The reception we met with as strangers, was
highly flattering. It was the character of Englishmen that was our
passport. Expressing our wish to see the prince, the court being
then full, we were addressed by a gentleman (whom we afterwards
found to be Lord Athlone) through whose politeness we
gained admission, and were with great affability noticed by the
prince. He is short in stature, with much elegance and familiarity
in his manner, not unlike our royal family. The princess and her
daughter, who is about eighteen, appeared in the room: their dresses
were very plain, and they had no other mark of superiority
than a train-bearer. So little ceremony is observed in the exterior
of the house, that just without the door of the apartment, where
the prince was giving audience (which was open), a woman was
on her knees scrubbing the staircase.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon my return to my hotel at one o’clock, the dinner hour,
I found a very agreeable party, composed of foreigners from different
countries, and an excellent <i><span lang="fr">table d’hote</span></i>: over the chimney-piece
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>was a good equestrian portrait of the famous Duke of Cumberland,
who lodged at this house occasionally during the campaigns
of 1747. After dinner, in company with a very amiable
gentleman-like Englishman, whom I met at the <i><span lang="fr">table d’hote</span></i>, I set
off in one of the carriages, many of which are always ready to convey
passengers, for about the value of six-pence English, for
Scheveling, a village which every traveller should visit, on account
of the beauty of the avenue leading to it, which is nearly two miles,
perfectly straight, and thickly planted with beech, limes, and oaks;
at the end of which superb vista the church of Scheveling appears.
On the sandy ground on each side of this avenue are several birch
thickets, and it abounds with the aiera canescens, hippophae rhamnoides,
a singular dwarf variety of ligustrum vulgare (Privet), the
true arundo epigejos of Linnæus (that is, calamagrostis), and a
number of heath plants, mixed with others usually found in
marshes. Scarcely is there so small a spot, where Flora presents
such opposite variety, and which the fluctuating moisture of the soil
can alone account for. Among the rarer species are convallaria
multiflora, and polygonatum, with gentiana cruciata, which is not
a native of England.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Dutch value this beautiful avenue as much as they do
their Wood, and great care is taken to preserve it from violation.
At the entrance, in a most romantic spot, is the turnpike-gate,
where all passengers, except the fishermen of Scheveling, pay a
fraction of a farthing for permission to enter; and here are stuck
up orders, threatening with punishment those who may attempt
to injure in the smallest degree this consecrated forest. At short
intervals, cautionary inscriptions are placed in conspicuous situations,
to warn mischievous “apple munching urchins” from cutting
the smallest twig.</p>

<p class='c007'>Constantine Huygens, brother of the celebrated mathematician
and mechanist of that name, had the honor of designing this avenue,
in which there are many stately trees, upwards of a century
and a half old: a terrible storm which took place a few years
since, laid about fifty of these noble objects low, to the great grief
and consternation of the country. Here, and perhaps here only,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>throughout Holland, the traveller may be gratified by the sounds
of a running brook. The foot paths on each side were crowded
with pedestrians of both sexes, in their holiday clothes; and the
slanting rays of a brilliant sun flashing through openings in the
branches of the limes, beech trees, and oaks, upon a crowd of
merry faces, jolting in the most whimsical carts and waggons, to
their favourite spot of carousal, had a very pleasing and picturesque
effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The village is very neat and pretty; at the end of the vista,
large sand-hills rising near the base of the church, preclude the
sight of the ocean, which, when they are surmounted, opens upon
the view with uncommon majesty. The beach, which we saw in
high perfection on account of its being low water, is very firm to
the tread, and forms a beautiful walk of nearly six miles in extent.
The ocean was like a mirror, and fishing vessels were reclining
on the sand in the most picturesque forms, just surrounded with
water; their owners, with their wives and children, were parading
up and down in their sabbath suits, and the whole sand for a mile
was a fine marine mall, covered with groupes who appeared as capable
of appreciating the beauty of the scene, as the worshippers
of the Steyne at Brighton, or of the Parade at Bath. The Dutch
are said to have an antipathy to sea-air; but this I found not to be
generally true: certain it is, that they are not fond of sea-bathing,
otherwise this beach would be crowded with bathing, and the
country above it with lodging-houses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Water is no novelty to a Dutchman, and he prefers, and there
seems some sense in his preference, his neat, commodious country-house,
and his gardens, and all the comforts of life about him,
to the pleasure of bathing and contemplating a waste of waters
from the windows of a cheerless inn or lodging-house. An English
frigate, which lay off at a considerable distance, excited a good
deal of attention, and added to the beauty of the scene. Upon quitting
the beach we entered an inn which overlooked the sand and
was a place of great resort, every room of which was crowded and
filled with tobacco smoke. The state of Mr. Fox’s health formed the
leading feature of the political discourse. “Herr Fock,” as he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>called, was frequently repeated at every table. Opposite to where
we sat a young Dutch couple were making violent love; they
kissed, devoured dry salted fish, and drank punch with an enthusiasm,
which presented to our imagination the warmest association
of Cupid and the jolly god. John Van Goyen, who died in
1656, and was so justly celebrated for the transparency of his colouring
of water, made this spot the frequent subject of his charming
pencil. Dutch tradition dwells with delight upon a cock and a
bull story respecting the celebrated flying chariot which used to
sail upon those lands, and on the surrounding country. It was said
to have been made by Stevinus, for Prince Maurice: it is thus
described and commented upon in a curious old description of
Holland: “The form of it was simple and plain: it resembled a
boat moved upon four wheels of an equal bigness, had two sails,
was steered by a rudder placed between the two hindmost wheels,
and was stopt either by letting down the sails, or turning it from
the wind. This noble machine has been celebrated by many great
authors, as one of the most ingenious inventions later ages have
produced. Bishop Wilkins, in his Treatise of Mechanical Motions,
mentions several great men who described and admired it. Grotius
mentions an elegant figure of it in copper, done by Geyneus; and
Herodius, in one of his large maps of Asia, gives another sketch
of the like chariots used in China.” Incredible as this story appears,
one would be disposed to think, that a man of Grotius’s
celebrity for learning and truth, would scarcely have eulogized the
invention, had he doubted its existence. Upon a level, hard, straight
road, uninterrupted by trees and buildings, such a piece of ingenuity
might perhaps prove successful as a mechanical experiment,
but utterly impossible ever to be made serviceable.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The coast of Scheveling is considered very dangerous in
rough weather: the spires of the church here, and those of Gravesande
and Monster, three leagues to the south, serve for landmarks;
yet, owing to the coast of the province of Holland lying very
low and flat, they are scarcely discernible three or four leagues at
sea: for want of sand-banks to break the force of the sea,
the coast is much exposed, and the fishermen are obliged, after
their return, to haul their vessels on rollers up the beach beyond
the water’s reach: this labour must be very great, for many of
them are from twenty to thirty-five tons burthen.</p>

<p class='c007'>This place has been at different periods subject to dreadful
irruptions of the sea, particularly in the year 1574, when it broke
in, and carried away 121 houses: Scheveling has its portion of
historic celebrity. In 1650, the expatriated Charles II. after a long
exile, embarked from this place for Scotland, to which he was
invited, with a promise of assistance in recovering the rest of his
dominions. Clarendon, in his History, vol. iii. p. 287, says, the
king went from the Hague to Scheveling, where “the States of
Holland, at infinite hazard to themselves from Cromwell and England,
suffered their ship to transport him. They gave all countenance
to the Scotch merchants and factors who lived in their dominions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>and some credit, that they might send arms and ammunition,
and whatsoever else was necessary for the king’s service,
into that kingdom.” And this the States did “when the king was
at his lowest ebb, and was heartily weary of being in a place
(Paris) where he was very ill-treated, and lived very uncomfortably,
and from whence he foresaw he should soon be driven.”
Having experienced the most romantic vicissitudes after his escape
from Worcester, this monarch, in the disguise of a sailor, escaped
to Dieppe in Normandy, in 1651; and he again, in 1660, embarked
at Scheveling on board of his own fleet, which was waiting to
receive him. The grateful monarch declared war against his Dutch
friends in 1672, and entered into a private league with the French
king to lay waste their provinces with fire and sword. From this
beach too the Stadtholder, his son the hereditary prince, and two
or three Dutch noblemen attached to the prostrate fortunes of the
house of Orange, embarked when they fled to England: the vessel
they sailed in was a small fishing cutter, navigated by five men;
the princesses took their departure in a similar conveyance the
day before.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another interesting event also is recorded as having occurred
off this coast, by Bishop Burnet, who in the History of his Own
Times thus relates this marvellous circumstance: “There was one
extraordinary thing happened near the Hague this summer (1672);
I had it from many eye-witnesses, and no doubt was made of the
truth of it by any at the Hague. Soon after the English fleet had
refitted themselves, they appeared in sight of Scheveling, making
up to the shore. The tide turned, but they reckoned that with the
next flood they could certainly land the forces that were on board,
where they were like to meet with no resistance. The States sent
to the prince for some regiments to hinder the descent. He could
not spare many men, having the French near him; so between
the two, the country was given up for lost unless De Ruyter should
quickly come up. The flood returned, which the people thought was
to end in their ruin; but to all their amazement, after it had flowed
two or three hours, an ebb of many hours succeeded, which carried
the fleet again to sea; and before that was spent, De Ruyter came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>in view. This they reckoned a miracle wrought for their preservation.”
It is also a curious circumstance that the reverse of this extraordinary
effort of nature enabled the immortal Nelson to lay his
fleet so as to bear upon the batteries by which the capital of Denmark
was protected. The tide had never been known, in the memory
of the oldest inhabitant of Copenhagen, to have risen so
high as on the day when the battle first commenced, and greatly
contributed to his success in persuading the gallant Danes that
they were beaten.</p>

<p class='c007'>De Ruyter, the Nelson of the Dutch, was distinguished for the
boldness of his designs and the celerity of his execution. In 1653,
with Van Tromp, he commanded the Dutch fleet against this
country with the greatest honour to his flag. The Moors presented
him with a Barbary horse, magnificently caparisoned, for his
gallantly reaching his destined port in the Salee roads, and for capturing
five powerful Algerine corsairs. The celebrated vice-admiral
d’Estrés said of him in a letter to Colbert, on account of his noble
conduct in those hard-fought engagements between the English,
Dutch, and French fleets off the Texel, “I should be very willing
to purchase with my life the glory which De Ruyter has acquired
in these desperate actions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On our return we met groups of little girls, whose short petticoats,
and protuberances on all sides, looked very grotesque.
Many of the Dutch girls of the lower order wear twenty or thirty
yards of flannel tied round their hips. In the village is a pauper
house for the poor and aged, founded in 1614. On a week day, the
road from Scheveling is more characteristically gay, being covered
with fishwomen running and singing to the Hague, under loads
of soles, cod, turbot, &#38;c. to which place I returned, highly delighted
with my excursion. In the neighbourhood of that city are
several fine flower-gardens. The passion of the Dutch for flowers
is well known. M. Dutens, in his very entertaining and interesting
Memoirs of a Traveller in Retirement, says, that at
the kermis or fair held at the Hague in the month of May, “I
was witness to a circumstance I could not otherwise have believed,
respecting the price of flowers in Holland; I saw four hundred
and seventy-five guineas offered and refused for a hyacinth. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>to be sure the most charming flower that ever was seen: it belonged
to a florist at Haarlem, and <em>another florist offered this price for
it</em>. The reason which the owner gave me for refusing the offer
was, that his hyacinth was known to all the amateurs of Europe,
and that he sold the bulbs every year for more than the interest of
five hundred guineas. These bulbs produced the same sort of
flower in all its beauty.” This singular passion has not subsided:
at Haarlem fine narcissuses and jonquils sell for an immense
price, and parties are made every summer to visit the roses, which
grow in great perfection at Noordwyk.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon our return to the Hague, we visited a palace of the <i><span lang="fr">ci-devant</span></i>
hereditary Prince of Orange; it forms three sides of an
oblong square towards the street; it was converting into a public
office; behind are some pretty gardens, one of which is less formal
than Dutch gardens in general. I concluded the day by walking
round a great part of the town, the whole of which is surrounded
with avenues of trees, similiar to, but not so fine as the
boulevards of Rouen. In the fish-market, the next day, I saw
several storks, who were parading about in perfect security, of
which they seemed to be thoroughly satisfied, and were every now
and then regaled by the offal of the fish. The prejudices of the
people have consecrated these birds, on account of their being
considered as the <i><span lang="fr">gardes du corps</span></i> of republican liberty. The
Greeks and Romans regarded them with peculiar veneration; and
in Thessaly the destroyer of one was punished with exile. No
animal but this discovers any token of fondness for the authors of
its existence after it has attained strength and discrimination sufficient
to provide for itself. The stork is well known to evince an
exemplary regard for its aged parents, whom it defends from attack,
and furnishes with food; and well did it deserve the Roman
appellation of “pia avis.” The Dutch frequently erect frames of
wood upon the tops of their houses to encourage these their favourite
birds to build their nests there. Perhaps another reason
why these birds are so much cherished is that which renders them
popular in Germany, namely, on account of their quick perception
of fire, and the noise they make when it takes place. If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Dutch really believed that the storks could exist only in a pure
republic, they must for some time past have renounced their credulity,
for these birds have survived the visits of the French, and
seem to have no objection to be enrolled amongst the subjects of
the new King. It is said that they assemble at certain periods and
hold consultations. Certain it is that the crows in England frequently
meet with all the appearance of a deliberative body. A
gentleman of distinguished talents and veracity assured me, that
he once observed a vast body of crows assembled near his country-house, that after making a great deal of noise, one of them moved
slowly into the middle, soon after which the rest fell upon him and
pecked him to death. The quails are another species of privileged
birds in Holland, particularly in Guelderland, where they are preserved
with superstitious care in cages suspended on the outsides
of houses. The swan too is much venerated here, and the raven is
greatly cherished at Nimeguen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The traveller will be well remunerated for his trouble in ascending
to the top of the tower of St. Jacques, the only high devotional
building in the Hague, except the new church: to obtain
permission to do so, it is necessary to apply to the principal magistrate
of the police, the reason for which precaution I could not
learn. The view from this elevation is exquisitely beautiful; below,
on one side lay expanded the square, the venerable pile of the
town palace, its superb basin, the noble streets leading towards the
wood, and the spires of distant villages fading in midst of the horizon;
whilst, on the other side, stretched the avenues of Scheveling,
terminated by the blue and sparkling ocean.</p>

<p class='c007'>A whimsical little penalty followed this gratification; at the hotel
where I resided, a Dutch waiter attended me, who imposed
upon his master to believe that he spoke English very fluently, in
consequence of which he was selected to wait upon all English and
American visitors: the English language of this personage was a
ridiculous collection of the heads, legs, wings, and tails of English
words, mingled together with all the confusion of a giblet-pye.
Upon my expressing to this flippant gentleman my wish to ascend
the <em>tower</em> of the church, he said, interrupting me, “Oh, de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span><em>roof</em>, de <em>roof</em>.” I acquiesced, and away he flew; about an hour afterwards
he returned in high perspiration with a billet, which instead
of proving to be an order to view the town and country from
the <em>roof</em> of the tower, was an acknowledgment of money for the
<i><span lang="nl">ruif</span></i> of the treckschuyt for Leyden the day following, viz. the
whole of the cabin which he had engaged and paid the amount of
for me.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Holland, that bee-hive of industry, every available source of
service is made use of, so that dogs, and even goats, are not suffered
to pick the bone, or eat the bread of idleness. Most of the
little wares and merchandizes, and particularly fish, are drawn by
the former, who are properly harnessed for the occasion to little
carts, whilst the latter are yoked to infantine waggons and curricles,
to air and exercise little children in. It is really astonishing
to see what weight these animals will draw after them; nothing
can exceed their docility, and for their labour, the Hollander, who
is remarkable for his humanity to the dumb creation, feeds them
well, and lodges them in his house very comfortably. Owing to
the great care paid to their dogs, the canine madness seldom appears
amongst them. On Sundays they are permitted to refresh
and enjoy themselves, and never show any disposition to escape
from their lot of industry. In their farms, cows and oxen are always
used in draft, and display every appearance of receiving the
kindest treatment from their masters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The theatre at the Hague is tastefully arranged, and supplied
with a tolerable set of French comedians. The centre box is appropriated
for the royal family, and is elegantly fitted up. Before
the conversion of the republic into a kingdom, when the government
resided in the hands of the Batavian directory, the ornaments
of the box which was allotted to them, were very unworthy
of the rank of the personages for whose accommodation it was
reserved: a piece of paper, on which was written, “Le loge du
directoire Batave,” and pasted on the box door, alone announced the
dignity of its destination. The usual national spirit of economy
used to display itself in the Dutch theatre, where, to prevent a
useless consumption of tallow, whenever the musicians quitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>the orchestra, they were bound by contract to extinguish the lights
by which they read their music. In many tradesmen’s houses at
this day in Holland, winter courtships are carried on in the dark,
the union of warm love and rigid economy being considered a very
laudable conjunction.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we are to give credit to the ridiculous story which is still
believed at a village called Loosduynen, about three miles from
the Hague, the ladies are far from being economical in breeding.
A Dutch author has gone so far as to declare, that he had seen the
three hundred and sixty-five children of the Countess of Henesberg,
and with pleasant minuteness describes them to be of the
size of shrimps, and Erasmus believed the story. Those who have
the hardihood to differ from such authorities, explain away the
miracle by stating, that on the <em>third</em> day of <em>January</em>, the beggar
wished the countess, who expected to lie in every hour, might
have as many children as there had been days in the year, and that
she on that day was delivered of <em>three</em> children.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hague was once celebrated for its many elegant, and
especially for its literary societies; the latter have declined, whilst
those of France have flourished and improved, amidst the frightful
fluctuations of revolutionary tumult. Erasmus, Grotius, and
Boerhaave, have conferred immortality upon the letters of Holland,
as they would upon those of any nation; but the literary
glory of the country seems not to have spread upon the demise of
these illustrious sages. Hooft, Vondel, and Antonides, are known
in Holland, but not out of it; and we have heard but faintly of
Huygens, Graveszande, and Vandoveron in physic; of Voet in
jurisprudence, and Burman and Gronovius in the belles lettres.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is certain, that if the Dutch poets are to be considered as
favoured by Apollo, a condescension which those who are best
acquainted with their productions much doubt, they have made
more successful advances in the most difficult of poetical composition.
I have heard of three epic writers; Antonides, before mentioned,
who wrote an epic poem on the river Y, on which the city
of Amsterdam is erected; Rotzans, and the author of Abraham de
Aartsvader, or the history of Abraham the Patriarch. The Dutch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>mention with great exultation the name of De Cotts, who, like our
Prior, united the characters of poet and statesman; his sensibility
is said to have been very acute, his fancy very luxuriant, and his
powers of versification very mellifluous. So attractive were the
Muses, that when he held the splendid office of lord keeper of the
seals in Holland and West Friesland, and stadtholder of the fiefs,
he retired to his native shades to tune his oaten reed, which entitled
him amongst his countrymen to the appellation of the Dutch
Ovid: at the earnest solicitation of their high mightinesses, he
quitted his lyre and beloved retreat, and appeared at the court of
Cromwell in the character of ambassador of the States to England,
where he was received with that politeness and attention which
our country never fails to observe towards strangers of merit and
distinction. Having accomplished the object of his mission, he retired
from the bustle of life to his native country, in the bosom of
which he expired, beloved, honoured, and lamented.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was not much surprised to find that the splendor of the
Hague was principally confined to its buildings, although it has
been so often, in other times, celebrated for its magnificence and
the expense of its inhabitants: the revolution expelled its hereditary
princes, dispersed its nobles, and visited every description of society
with more or less distress. However, I was informed by those
who were enabled to compare, that it is again rearing its head.
Before the revolution, sumptuous equipages and various other
characteristics of polished luxury were displayed in almost every
street; and the foreign ministers vied with each other in costly
splendor: during the operation of that political hurricane scarce
any other carriage was to be seen save a few crazy fiacres, and
every servant was stripped of his livery. At present, society seems
to be returning to many of its original habits, and some handsome
equipages appeared in different parts of the town; yet, upon the
whole, the first impression of its gloom was never effaced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon inquiry after the present state of literature at this place,
I found it was considered at a very low ebb: the press of the
Hague was once justly celebrated, but has of late emitted little
more than a few pamphlets of inconsiderable merit. Before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>revolution there were several capital booksellers’ shops, of which
I could only discover two; the books in their shops, apparently
the remains of declining literary traffic, were neither very numerous
nor very valuable. The booksellers formerly found very ample
encouragement in the affluence of the court, and many petty German
princes who selected the Hague for their residence. It has
been asserted that as the Hague contained the seat of the executive
government and of the representative bodies during the revolution,
it suffered much less than any other town in the republic; but this
I was well assured was not the case, because the commercial towns
still derived resources from their commerce and enterprize,
through the medium of neutral bottoms and other circuitous modes
of traffic, notwithstanding the severity of British blockades and
the vigilance of British cruisers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hague has produced several very distinguished painters;
amongst others I must beg to mention Daniel Mytens, who was
born in 1636, and went to study at Rome, and afterwards employed
himself in designing after the antique, in copying the most celebrated
paintings of the best artists, and adding considerably to his
improvement by an intimacy which he formed there with Carlo
Maratti and Carlo Loti. The dreadful habits of dissipation to
which Mytens was addicted, deplorably interfered with his advancement
in his profession. His imagination was lively, his colouring
agreeable, his composition good, and he designed with great facility.
After a long residence in Italy, he returned to the Hague, where
he was much admired and cherished by the lovers of the arts: his
eminent qualities were displayed in those works which he painted
at Rome, and upon his return to the Hague, where, not many
years after, his productions became greatly depreciated, from his
constant indulgence in the most intemperate excesses, to which he
at length fell a victim in the year 1688. He acquired much and
deserved reputation for the sketch of a very noble design for a
ceiling of the painters’ hall at the Hague: this work commenced,
and left unfinished for some years; at length he roused himself
from his indolence, but it was only to show what ravages it had
made on his fine abilities, for he only injured the work which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>attempted to improve. Another distinguished artist, who has shed
lustre upon the Hague, is John Hanneman, who was born here in
1611; by some he was said to have been a pupil of Vandyke. By
others, and with greater probability, that of Hubert Ravestein;
and in the soft and delicate tints of his carnations, he is considered
to be very little inferior to Vandyke: many of Hanneman’s copies
of that illustrious artist are mistaken for the originals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hanneman continued in England sixteen years, and upon his
return to the Hague became the favourite painter of the Princess
of Orange: he was also employed by the Prince of Nassau, for
whom he painted, amongst others, several historical pictures,
which are now highly esteemed. The third and last artist I shall
mention is John le Duc, who was born at the Hague in 1636,
and was a disciple of Paul Potter, so justly celebrated as a painter
of cattle, whose works, however, are often scarcely distinguishable
from those of his pupil. His principal subjects were the same as
those of his master, viz. horses, sheep, goats, cows, &#38;c. He finished
his pictures very highly, and possessed great facility of pencil
and purity of style. He was appointed director of the academy of
painting at the Hague in the year 1671. The desire of distinguishing
himself in arms induced him to exert all his interest to obtain
a company, and such was his gallantry in the field, that he obtained
the epithet of “Brave,” after which, unfortunately for the arts, he
neither painted nor designed.</p>

<p class='c008'>After spending some days very pleasantly at the Hague, I
proceeded to the Leyden treckschuyt, which lay at a great distance
from the hotel, where I found, from the blunder of the waiter before
detailed, that I was considered as a personage of considerable
consequence, on account of my having engaged the whole of the
ruif to myself. The day was brilliantly fine, and nothing could be
more delightful than my passage to Leyden: for two miles and a
half the left bank of the canal presented an unbroken succession
of handsome country-houses and highly cultivated grounds, which
although laid out like so many vegetable problems, abounded with
a variety of forms, which, as they were clad in luxuriant green,
were very agreeable. Many of these spots were graced by the acacia
and Weymouth pine, to which the soil and climate seemed to
be congenial. On the other side were rich meadows, whose vivid
green seemed to rival that of the emerald, and corn-fields yellow
with harvest. Enchanted with the day and the scenery, I envied
not the aquatic pomp of Cleopatra, although</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>The blunder of the waiter added not a little to the delights of
my passage, for I sat a solitary grandee upon the top of the cabin,
without a soul to interrupt the happy frame of my mind formed by
the lovely prospects on every side of me. In this agreeable manner
three hours and a half passed away with feathered fleetness,
and at the end of a long avenue of trees and a line of water, the
spires and elevated buildings of Leyden appeared. We stopped
about half way from the Hague at Leydehendam, a very neat
pretty village, the neighbourhood of which abounds with pleasure
houses and gardens. The country as I approached Leyden appeared
to be thickly wooded, and displayed the novel variety of a
gentle undulation of ground. After passing through a beautiful
boulevard, and crossing some drawing bridges, I entered the elegant
city of Leyden through the white gate, and proceeded to a
very comfortable hotel in the principal street, called the Broad
street, the length, spaciousness, and beauty of which entitles it to
the highest admiration: there is no canal in it, and the buildings
on each side are very handsome, many of them splendid mansions.
This seat of learning is considered to be one of the handsomest in
Holland, and next in size to Amsterdam; the entrance to it is
through seven stone gates, at each of which is a draw-bridge: the
town is surrounded with a rampart, and a deep, broad canal, and
is adorned by beautiful shady walks. The number of bridges in
this city is astonishing, they are said to exceed one hundred and
forty-five of stone and railed with iron. It has also many canals,
the most beautiful of which is the Rapenburg. It has been compared
by travellers to Oxford, but I cannot see any resemblance,
except in its being devoted to learning, and consequently presenting
many of those features of meditation and consequent tranquillity,
which are to be found in places destined to similiar objects:
but in its fortification, its buildings, streets, and canals, there
is unquestionably no resemblance. The channels or gutters of the
Broad street are covered with boards which open like a trap door,
into which the moment any dirt is lodged, it is removed by persons
appointed for that purpose; and lofty common pumps, with
large brass ornaments constantly scoured and kept bright, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>placed in different parts of it, to supply the inhabitants and to
purify the street, of which they are not a little proud. The fame
of Lucas Van Leyden made the stadt-house or town-hall the object
of my first visit; it is a vast gothic building, presenting a very
long irregular front, in a very uncouth style of architecture, surmounted
by a small steeple, which is crowded with carillons, and
stands in the centre of the Broad street. As I ascended the grand
staircase, a painter was giving a finishing touch to some large
stone lions, which by way of blending them with the stone colour
of the rest of the building, he had painted <em>vividly red</em>. In one of
the apartments, which was very heavy and gloomy, I beheld the
celebrated production of Lucas Van Leyden, or Hugens, who was
born here in 1494, and died in 1533. This picture is in three divisions,
the two external smaller ones being made like folding
doors, to close if necessary over the middle one. The subject is
the last judgment, for which vast sums of money have been repeatedly
offered to the magistrates of the town and refused. I
must confess I felt no more pleasure in contemplating this picture
than what arose from its great antiquity. There are a great number
of figures in it: the females are wholly destitute of beauty, at
the same time there is a freedom in the outline: many of their
limbs appear to be elongated, and every head seems to have been
taken from the same subject, and wholly destitute of expression;
however, considering the early period in which the artist flourished,
it is a very curious and valuable production. This painter was
instructed in the principles of his art by his father, Hugens Jacobs,
an artist of some consideration: it is said that Lucas from his infancy
displayed incessant application, and at the age of nine and
twelve years astonished the artists of his time by his works. After
he had learned the rudiments of his art under his father, he became
a pupil of Cornelius Engelbrecht; at the age of fifteen he painted
the history of St. Hubert, which elevated him to high distinction
in his art. On account of the principles of perspective not being
known in his early time, he proportioned the strength of his colouring
to the different degrees of distance, in which his objects
were placed. He painted not only in oil, but in destemper and on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>glass. A famous print of this master’s engraving, the subject a
bagpiper, is also mentioned, which sold for a hundred ducatoons
or twenty pounds sterling.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the justice hall is a celebrated picture of Harel de Moor,
who was born in this town in 1656; the subject, Brutus condemning
his sons, the design, the colouring and finishing of which are
very beautiful. De Moor had great and highly merited honours
paid to him by various princes and distinguished personages, particularly
by the emperor of Germany who directed his ambassador
Count Singendoff to engage him to paint the portraits of Prince
Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough on horseback, with which
his imperial patron was so gratified, that he conferred upon him
the honour of knighthood, and nobly rewarded him in a more substantial
manner for his admirable production: he had also the
honour of painting that mighty savage of the North, Peter the
Great, Czar of Muscovy. Under the picture of Brutus are some
elegant Latin verses; there is also a large picture representing the
bravery of its citizens, who are rendered immortal in the page of
history for the heroic valour they displayed during a siege, which
in the year 1573, for five months, visited this place with all the
horrors of war, disease, and famine. The historian can scarcely do
adequate justice to these heroes. After the Spaniards had been
compelled to raise the siege of Alkmaar, they determined upon
directing their forces against Leyden, from the trenches of which
they were bravely repulsed by Count Louis of Nassau, brother to
the then Prince of Orange; but having been reinforced, they returned
to the attack; when the Spanish general, Francis Valdey,
discovering that he could not take the place by storm, resolved
upon reducing it by famine, and a scene of horror ensued which
baffles the powers of the pen to describe. The Spanish General,
Frederic of Toledo, son of the execrable Duke of Alva, repulsed
a body of English auxiliaries who were coming to the relief of the
besieged, in consequence of which the blockade was so vigilantly
conducted, that the wretched inhabitants could derive no provisions
from without. In this dreadful dilemma, they drew lots to determine
which should fall each day to afford sustenance to the rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>with their bodies; and it is said that the spirit of patriotism ran so
high, that many of them anticipated this desperate alternative, and
voluntarily slew themselves to furnish food to their brave fellow-citizens
and soldiers. An extraordinary female patriot, of the name
of Kenneva, headed the women, led them to the ramparts, where
they assisted the nearly exhausted soldiery in working the cannon,
and displayed that enthusiastic courage which great occasions will
generally find lodged in that bosom which is the seat of every
gentle, every tender feeling, and ought only to heave with the
tenderest emotions. Many of them stabbed themselves, to assist in
preserving the survivors, and expiring exclaimed, “See, my poor
valiant friends, your provision for the rest of the day.” But notwithstanding
these terrible sacrifices, and supplies of human flesh, many
thousands of the garrison and burghers perished. The Spaniards,
having been informed of their situation, again summoned them to
surrender, and allowed a truce of an hour for deliberation, during
which a consultation was held, the unanimous determination of which
was contained the following reply: “Tell your arrogant general, that
we shall not want the means of life whilst a left arm remains upon
any of our shoulders, and with our right we shall continue to fight
for our liberties to the last.” At length, broken down by their frightful
situation, and hopeless of relief, after having exhibited prodigies
of valor, and the sublimest acts of patriotism and resignation,
the miserable survivors of this ghastly scene of desolation assembled
round the house of Peter Adrian de Werf, the chief magistrate
of the city, a man of great influence amongst the people,
and implored him to sanction with his fiat the surrender of the
place; but this noble being preferring, like Cato, to perish rather
than see his country in the possession of a tyrant, thus addressed
his emaciated brethren: “My brave comrades! cut this body in
pieces; it is better that I should die <em>for</em> you, than <em>by</em> the enemy:
my wounds disable me from further service. Take courage, let
me receive death from your hands, and let my miserable frame
furnish a wretched meal for some of you. Take me, and may Leyden
be victorious, and her glory immortal!” Deeply impressed by
such firmness and eloquence, his auditors turned their haggard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>countenances aside, and with the convulsive energy of expiring
nature, rushed again to the rampart, and soon afterwards they
were thrown into an agony of joy by the arrival of two carrier
pigeons, to whose feet were tied stalks of corn and hemp, in which
letters were concealed, announcing that relief was at hand. The
Dutch confederates, having no other mode of relieving the inhabitants
of Leyden, broke down the dykes of the Maese and the
Yssel, inundated the Spanish camp, and the beautiful country
which surrounds Leyden, and enabled Louis Brissot, admiral of
Zealand, to send many flat-bottomed boats, well armed, to the succour
of the besieged. This desperate measure compelled the Spanish
general to evacuate his camp, and to retire with such of his
army as did not perish by the waters, into their own country. This
siege, which commenced shortly after Easter, was raised the third
of October, on which day a supply of provisions was brought to
the famished inhabitants, who greedily devoured the food, amidst
tears and convulsive inarticulate exclamations to heaven for their
delivery, and many of them dropped down dead upon too rapidly
satisfying their ravenous appetites. After this signal deliverance,
the Prince of Orange, although suffering under severe illness,
ordered himself to be carried in a litter to Leyden, to condole with
and express his admiration of its heroic inhabitants: the interview,
as well as many scenes which occurred during the siege, must
have afforded a fine subject for the pencil. He gave them their
option of being exempted for a certain period from taxes, or of
having an university founded in their town; when, with noble and
disinterested wisdom, they gave the preference to the latter. Never
did any seat of learning originate from a nobler cause: it may be
said to have been endowed by the blood of the brave. The clergy of
Leyden, in a public oration, still celebrate the anniversary of the
glorious third of October, in which the story of the siege, and the
deliverance of the town are feelingly recapitulated. I was surprised
to find that such a subject had not more frequently engaged the
pencil of the many divine artists which Holland has produced:
the picture which led me to mention the above story is, in my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>humble opinion, unworthy of the subject; the figures are badly
grouped, and express no one emotion which can affect the mind.
After quitting the stadt-house, the evening being very fine, I
ascended a large mount, which may be considered as a great
curiosity in Holland, in the centre of the town, where there is
a fine view of it: this mount is surrounded by a high wall, and
is said to be the scite of a castle built by Hengist, king of the
West Saxons, on his conquest in England, or, what is more
likely, by one of the antient counts of Holland. The town presented
a very beautiful appearance from this spot, but it is not
elevated enough to enable the visitor to see the surrounding country:
the fruit-trees in the gardens which encompassed the wall
were loaded with very fine fruit, particularly pears, plumbs, and
apples. This place is much resorted to, on Sundays and holidays,
by the citizens and their families, to smoke and enjoy the beauty
of the prospect, and the refreshing sweetness of the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning I visited the university of Leyden, which
stands by the Rapenburg canal: it is the most venerable seminary
in Holland; and, by the great number of learned and famous
men which it has produced, does honour to the luster of its origin.
There is scarcely a science which has not been improved and
extended in this hallowed seat of learning; which has to boast
amongst its members the immortal name of the younger Scaliger,
who bequeathed to it his valuable Hebrew library; of the two
Hensius, father and son; the former of whom was invited by Pope
Urban the eighth to Venice, “to rescue,” as he expressed it,
“that city from barbarism;” and both of whom shone like stars of
the first magnitude in every branch of graceful literature; of Salmasius,
the profound and able competitor of our immortal Milton;
of Boerhaave, whose consummate knowledge of physic, attracted
pupils from the most distant parts of Europe; and of many other
illustrious persons, who have shed honour and distinction upon
their country and the times in which they flourished. The students
board in town at different lodging-houses, wherever their inclinations
or resources may dispose them; they wear no regular habit;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>when the professors appear in public, they wear a large black
silk gown, bordered with velvet, on which the word ‘Leyden’ is
worked in silver. My next visit was to the botanic garden, rendered
immortal by the illustrious Boerhaave, as that of Upsal, in Sweden,
has been by Linnæus. Haller says, in speaking of Boerhaave in
the Leyden Botanical Garden, “<i><span lang="la">sæpe vidimus ante Auroram optimum
senen ligneiscalceis per hortum repentem, ut comminus et cultum herbarum
perspiceret, et flores fructusque specularetur</span></i>.” We have often
seen the good old man before the morning dawn, crawling about
the garden in the wooden slippers, that he might immediately
superintend the culture of plants, and speculate on their flowers
and fruits. This great man was born at Woerhout, near Leyden,
in 1668; at the age of fifteen he found himself without parents,
protection, advice, or fortune: he had then profoundly studied
theology, intending to devote himself to a clerical life; but the
science of nature presented all her attractions, and for some time
wholly absorbed his contemplation. In 1693 he was created doctor
of physic, which he then regularly practised. At this time he could
scarcely exist by his labours, and was compelled to teach the
mathematics to procure the bare necessaries of life, although he
left at his demise the vast fortune of two hundred thousand pounds.
At length his genius dissolved the darkness in which he was enveloped,
many powerful friends gathered round him, and procured
for him the valuable appointments of professor of medicine in the
university of Leyden, of chemistry, and of botany. The Academy
of Sciences at Paris and the Royal Society at London, to each of
which he imparted his discoveries in chemistry, invited him to
become one of their members. Whilst Boerhaave presided in the
chair, in chemistry, medicine, and botany, the city of Leyden was
considered the school of Europe in these sciences. In 1715, when
Peter the Great went to Holland to study maritime affairs, he
regularly attended the lectures of Boerhaave. So widely diffused
was his fame, that a mandarine in China wrote to him a letter thus
superscribed; “<em>To the illustrious Boerhaave, physician in Europe</em>,”
and it was regularly received. It was the daily practice of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>eminent physician, through his whole life, as soon as he rose in
the morning, which was generally very early, to retire for an hour
to private prayer, and meditation on some part of the Scriptures.
He often told his friends, when they asked him how it was possible
to go through so much fatigue, that it was <em>this</em> which gave him
spirit and vigour in the business of the day. This he therefore recommended
as <em>the best rule</em> he could give; for nothing, he said, could
tend more to the health of the body than the tranquillity of the
mind, and that he knew nothing which could support himself and his
fellow-creatures, amidst the various distresses of human life but a
well-grounded confidence in the Supreme Being, upon the principles
of christianity: the truth of his doctrine he finely illustrated in
his severe illness in 1722, when the course of his lectures and his
practice were long interrupted. Of his sagacity and wonderful
penetration in the discovery and description of such distempers
as betray themselves by no symptoms to common eyes, such surprising
accounts have been given, as scarcely can be credited,
though attested beyond all doubt. Yet this great master of medical
knowledge was so far from feeling a presumptuous confidence
in his mighty talents, or from being inflated by his prodigious
wealth, that his condescension to the humblest being who approached
him, and his unceasing professional application were ever the
theme of admiration and astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>He often used to say, what will make many a practitioner in
physic tremble, that the life of a patient (if trifled with or neglected),
would one day be required at the hand of the physician. He
used to call the poor his best patients, nobly observing, that God
would be their paymaster; the lustre of his eyes bespoke the activity
and vivacity of his mind. He was always cheerful and desirous
of promoting every valuable end of conversation. He disregarded
calumny and detraction; for even Boerhaave had enemies,
and never troubled himself to confute them. “They are sparks,”
said he, “which, if you do not blow, will go out of themselves.
The surest remedy against scandal is to <em>live it down</em>, by a perseverance
in well doing; and by praying to God that he would cure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>the distempered minds of those who traduce and injure us.” He
was never over-awed by the magnificence or presence of great
men, but boldly persisted in proceeding in what he considered to
be right, and left the consequence to God. He was enabled, with
unexampled celerity and acuteness, to penetrate into the tempers
and characters of persons at a glance of his eye. A friend, one day,
who had often admired his patience under great provocations,
asked him, if he ever knew what it was to be angry? to which
Boerhaave replied with the most perfect frankness, “that he was
naturally quick of resentment; but, that by prayer and meditation,
he had obtained complete mastery over his passions; this he attributed,
as he did every good thought, and every laudable action,
to his God.”</p>

<p class='c007'>About the middle of the year 1737, he felt the first approaches
of that indisposition which was destined to bring him to his grave,
viz. a disorder in his breast, which was occasionally very painful,
often threatened him with immediate suffocation, and finally terminated
in an universal dropsy: during all the anguish which he suffered,
his placid temper and firmness of mind never forsook him;
he attended at once to the ordinary duties of life as if in full health,
and prepared for that death which his skill and experience enabled
him to know was not very distant.</p>

<p class='c007'>About three weeks before his dissolution, when the Rev. Mr.
Schultens, one of the most learned and exemplary divines of his
age, attended him at his country-house, the Doctor desired his
prayers, and afterwards entered into a sublime discourse with him
on the spiritual and immaterial parts of the soul, which he illustrated
with wonderful perspicuity, by a description of the effects which
the infirmities of his body had upon his faculties, which, however,
they did not so oppress, or vanquish, but his soul was always master
of itself, and always resigned to the pleasure of its Maker,
and then added, “He who loves God ought to think nothing desirable
but what is most pleasing to the supreme goodness.” As
death approached nearer, he seemed to be more happy, amidst the
increase of corporeal torments, and at length, on the 23d September,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>1738, he sunk under them in his 70th year. His funeral oration
was spoken in Latin before the university of Leyden, to a
crowded audience, by his friend Mr. Schultens, amidst tears of
genuine regret and sympathy. The city of Leyden has raised a
monument in the church of St. Peter, to the sanative genius of
Boerhaave, “Salutifero Boerhaavii genio sacrum.” It consists of an
urn upon a pedestal of black marble, with a group representing the
four ages of life, and the two sciences in which Boerhaave excelled.
The capital of this basis is decorated with a drapery of white
marble, in which the artist has shown the different emblems of
disorders, and their remedies. Upon the pedestal is the medallion of
Boerhaave; at the extremity of the frame, a ribband displays the
favourite motto of this learned man, “Simplex vigilum veri.” Professor
Allamand had destined a very fine piece of red jasper to be
employed in this medallion, but on account of the great expense
of cutting the stone his design was abandoned. His pictures represent
him as above the middle size, well proportioned, and of a
strong constitution; when age had silvered over his hair, his countenance
was said to have been extremely venerable and expressive,
and to have much resembled the head of Socrates, but with features
more softened and engaging. He was an eloquent orator,
and declaimed with great dignity and grace. He taught very methodically,
and with great precision, but always so captivated his
auditors, that they regretted the close of his discourses, which he
often enlivened with a sprightly turn of raillery; but it was ever
refined, ingenious, and incapable of offending. He used to say,
“that decent mirth was the salt of life.” In the practice of medicine
he gave a decided preference to green over dried herbs, thinking
that there was more virtue in herbs when they had their juices,
than when decayed and withered. He was a great admirer of simples,
and consequently was not a great patron of the apothecaries.
When health would permit he regularly rode on horseback; when
his strength began to fail he walked, and upon his return home,
music, of which he was passionately fond, gladdened the hours of
relaxation, and enabled him to return to his labours with redoubled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>alacrity. Dr. Johnson has written the following beautiful eulogium
on this great man; “A man formed by nature for great designs,
and guided by religion in the exertion of his abilities; determined
to lose none of his hours, when he had attained one science, he attempted
another; he added physic to divinity; chemistry to the
mathematics, and anatomy to botany. He recommended truth by
his elegance, and embellished the philosopher with polite literature;
yet his knowledge, however uncommon, holds in his character
but a second place; for his virtue was more uncommon than
his learning. He ascribed all his abilities to the bounty, and all his
goodness to the grace of his God. May those who study his writings
imitate his life! and those who endeavour after his knowledge,
aspire likewise to his piety.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The botanic garden is not very large; in the time of Boerhaave
it must have been small indeed, as its history represents it
to have been considerably enlarged since that period: in the frontispiece
of his Index Horti L. Bat. 1710, it is represented to be a
petty square piece of ground. It now occupies about four acres,
and is in excellent order: the trees and plants are marked according
to the Linnæan system; but it is infinitely inferior in value and arrangement
to the botanic gardens of Upsala and of the Dublin Society.
Amongst the plants, I approached with the reverence due
to it, the venerable remains of vegetable antiquity, in the shape of
a palm, which stands in a tub in the open air, supported by a thin
frame of iron work; it is about fourteen feet high, and was raised
from seed by the celebrated Carolus Clusius, who died professor at
Leyden in 1609: the professor who attended me, presented me
with a bit of its bark, as a little relic. This tree and the pot in
which it grows, are also figured in the frontispiece of Boerhaave’s
Index before mentioned: it there appears to have been about half
as high as at present, and is said to be the palm mentioned by Linnæus
in his Prælectiones in Ordines Naturales Plantarum, p. 27,
published by Giseke in 1792, at Hamburgh, which Linnæus suspected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>to be a chamærops, but which, as the ingenious Dr. Smith
observes, his editor rightly refers to the rhapis flabelli formis, Ait.
Hort. Kew, v. iii. p. 473. It comes from China and Japan: there
is a tree of this kind, and about as large, in the botanic garden at
Paris, and another at Pisa. In this garden is also the ginkgo of
the Chinese, a standard twenty feet high; Strelitzia reginæ, Ait.
Hort. Kew, v. i. p. 285, tab. 2, which has never yet flowered in
any garden out of England; the olea laurifolia, a new species according
to Mr. Van Royen; Royena lucida in flower, as large as a
moderate hawthorn tree, and thought to be very handsome; and a
singular plant from the Cape, supposed to be an echites, with a
large tuberous root raised high above the surface of the ground, two
or three weak stems a foot high, and large dark brown flowers. In
the university library is Rauwolf’s Herbarium, which is very magnificent,
and the plants well preserved; also Boccone’s Herbarium
of the plants described in his Fasciculus Plantarum, published by
Morison at Oxford, in 1674; these specimens are very poor: Herman’s
Collection of Ceylon Plants is also here, which are a part
of the celebrated Herbarium, the rest of which is at Copenhagen;
also a volume of West India plants, belonging to Herman, which
are very scarce in Holland, and a fine collection of mathematical
instruments; amongst other things, a most pure and brilliant prism
of Brazil pebble, and a two-inch cube of Iceland refracting spar,
perfectly clear and free from blemish.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a very long apartment in the gallery there are some busts
and statues in tolerable preservation, but of no great value; the
best are busts of Nero and Agrippina, Servilius and a Bacchus:
they were presented to the university by a citizen of the town. I
was shown into a small room containing some stuffed birds and
beasts, which were in very poor condition. The theatre of anatomy
is very near the botanic garden; in it is a valuable collection of
anatomical and pathological subjects. This hall is well worthy the
notice of the traveller, as well for its valuable contents, as for having
furnished Europe with some of its best physicians. This
library is celebrated throughout Europe, for the many valuable
specimens of oriental literature with which it abounds, exclusive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>of the books before mentioned. Golius, upon his return from
the East, and who afterwards filled with great reputation the
Arabic professorship of the university, has enriched this valuable
depositary of learning with many Arabic, Turkish, Chaldean, and
Persian manuscripts. I have before mentioned that Joseph Scaliger
bequeathed his valuable collection of Hebrew books to it.
The precious manuscripts contained here are said to exceed eight
thousand. Since the last war commenced, no addition of English
publications has been made to this library, which contains the
Transactions of the Royal and Antiquarian Societies of London,
and the Histories of Gibbon, Robertson, and Hume. To suffer an
inimical disposition between two countries to erect a barrier between
intellectual communication is giving additional barbarism
to the ferocity of war. To the honour of England and France, they
have never permitted those melancholy conflicts which have so
long, and so fatally inflamed the one against the other, to check
the free and liberal interchange of philosophical discovery and
literary investigation. Whilst the respective governments have
been engaged in reciprocal schemes of vengeance, the learned
societies of both countries have communed with each other in the
language of peace and liberality.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of Spain has presented this library with some magnificent
folios, descriptive of the antiquities of Herculaneum. The
books are principally bound in fine white parchment, and are
gilded and decorated with considerable taste and splendor. There
are in this room several excellent portraits of eminent men who
have belonged to the university, or who have been benefactors to
it: the head of that elegant and voluptuous poet Johannes Secundus,
who died at the age of twenty-five, distinguishable for its dark
penetrating eyes, adust complexion, and black hair and beard, is
very fine. There are also very interesting portraits of Janus Douse,
who during the siege of Leyden exhibited the most admirable
heroism, by which he acquired the applause of the Prince of Orange
and the government of the town: this hero shone in letters as well
as arms; also of Erasmus at different stages of his life; of Hugo
Donellus, painted after death, in which all the appearances of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>mortality are finely imitated with ghastly precision; also of Daniel
Heinsius, and a miniature of Sir Thomas More, by Hans Holbein.
There are also several medallion likenesses of distinguished Englishmen
carved in ivory, such as Milton, Marvel, Ludlow, Wickliffe,
Harrington, &#38;c. &#38;c. executed by an English refugee, who
took shelter in Holland after the overthrow of the Duke of Monmouth’s
rebellion. There is a museum of natural history, principally
collected by Professor Allemand, containing some fine ores,
corals, and pebbles, and also some rare quadrupeds and amphibia:
also a young ostrich in the egg; the nautilus with the animal in it,
and some papilios. In the anatomical theatre are the valuable preparations
of Albinus, amongst them are specimens of the progress
of ossification in the fœtus. This university has also to boast of the
works of Mr. Pestel, professor of jurisprudence, for his admirable
work, entitled Fundamenta Jurisprudentiæ Naturalis. The constitutional
regulations of this university are conceived in a noble
spirit of liberality. No offensive obligations, no religious tests, no
repulsive oaths, are imposed, no insidious attempts at proselytism
are exercised. Youths of every religious persuasion mingle together
in perfect harmony; like brothers they aggregate to study,
and not to quarrel about modes of faith. Whatever may be the
rank of the student, or from whatever country he may come, he
speedily adopts the decent, gentle, and frugal manners and habits
of the inhabitants. The long war and revolution in this country
have naturally withdrawn a great number of young men of rank
and fortune from this seminary, and prevented others from entering
it. The students do not now exceed two hundred. A considerable
number of English students, in a period of peace, used to
flock to this illustrious academy, which, as well as the beauty,
tranquillity, cleanliness, and salubrity of the city in which it stands,
and the cheapness and perfect freedom of living, and the charms
of the surrounding country, holds out the strongest attractions to
the recluse and studious. The examinations for academical honours
are more severe than even for those of Trinity College Dublin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Amongst other circumstances which have concurred to crown
Leyden with celebrity, I must not omit to relate that its neighbourhood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>gave birth to Rembrandt in 1606. His real name was
Gerretz, but he is known by the name of Van Ryn, an appellation
given to him from the place where he spent the youthful part of
his life, on the borders of the Rhine. This illustrious artist is one
amongst the many instances which might be produced, of the effect
of accidental circumstances in early life determining the character
and formation of genius; he derived his peculiarity of shade
from the circumstance of his father’s mill receiving light from an
aperture at the top, which, and not his studying under Jacob Pinas,
gradually led him to use that breadth of shade for which he was so
eminently distinguished. At a very early period he exhibited strong
proofs of genius for painting, and by his productions astonished his
master Jacques Van Zwanenburg, in whose school he continued
three years. His father’s mill, and the circumjacent country, first
attracted his attention, which, with the heavy living objects with
whom he associated, so completely possessed his mind, that he
seldom selected any others which were beautiful or graceful.
When very young, one of his friends prevailed upon him to go to
Amsterdam, and offer one of his pictures for sale, which he did,
and sold it to a very able judge of genius in his line for one hundred
florins. He went on foot with the treasure under his arm, but
returned in a carriage. This trifling circumstance induced him to
settle in that city, where he soon became solicited by persons of
the first distinction for his works. Here, from the number of pupils
who flocked to him, and the great demand for his paintings,
wealth poured in upon him copiously. For instructing each of his
pupils he received one hundred florins per annum, but becoming
avaricious as he became wealthy, he sold a great number of copies
made by them for his own pictures, in which he deceived the purchaser
by retouching several parts. The swindling tricks and stratagems
by which this great artist used to raise money, threw a
deeper breadth of shade than his pencil ever cast upon his canvass,
over the brighter parts of his genius. It is related that one
of his pupils, well knowing his rapacious disposition, painted
a number of coins upon some cards which he laid upon his master’s
table when he was from home; on his return, he ran eagerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>to seize them and recovered the vexation of his disappointment,
only by admiring the dexterity of the deception.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rembrandt was a great humourist. One day when he was painting
a large family picture, and one of the subjects was actually
sitting to him, his servant informed him of the death of his favourite
monkey, which he felt so sensibly, and whimsically, that he
immediately ordered the dead body to be brought in, and drew it
as one of the group, which he would not expunge, although the
family refused to pay for the picture before it was effaced. His
finest historical pictures are those of Ahasuerus, Esther and Haman;
the woman taken in adultery; and St. John preaching in the
wilderness, which are said to be touched with inexpressible fire
and spirit. The imagination of this great artist was lively and active,
and his invention very fertile: he had a large collection of old
draperies, armour, weapons, and turbans, which he used sportively
to call his antiques; these he preferred to any of the works of the
Grecian artists. He had also a great number of the finest Italian
prints, drawings, and designs, many of them taken from the antiques,
which afforded him gratification, but do not appear to have
ameliorated his taste. His portraits are excellent, and resemble
life as near to perfection as possible, but his airs and attitudes are
defective of grace and dignity. Many of his heads display such
minute exactness, that even the hairs of the beard, and the wrinkles
of old age, are given with the most exquisite fidelity. The
portrait appears to breathe upon the canvass. It is a curious circumstance
that his lights were produced by a colour unusually
thick, more resembling modeling than painting, but every tint
was so judiciously placed, that it remained on the canvass in full
freshness, beauty, and lustre. The etchings of Rembrandt are greatly
admired, and are regarded as prime treasures in the cabinets of
the curious in most parts of Europe: these productions rival his
paintings, every stroke of the graver exhibits expression and life:
his genuine works are rarely to be met with, but whenever they
are presented for sale, they produce incredible prices. In the
splendid collection of Mr. Desenfans, are some exquisite productions
of this and other Flemish masters; this collection is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>upon the whole, the best in England, and is exhibited to persons
of respectability, without cost, by its liberal possessor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Amongst the curiosities of Leyden, I did not take the trouble
of seeing the shopboard of the celebrated John of Leyden, a character
distinguishable for its ambition, enterprize, and ferocity:
those who have furnished us with an account of this aspiring
monster, relate that his name was Bucold; that from being the son
of a taylor, and brought up to his father’s trade, he resolved upon
becoming a king; that accordingly he first tasted of royalty on
the board of a strolling company of comedians in the character
of a prince, which affording him much gratification, he connected
himself with a baker of Amsterdam, a fanatic, who called himself
God’s vicegerent upon the earth, and declared that he was sent to
illuminate the world. This fellow, previous to his becoming the
associate of John of Leyden, assumed the name of Thomas Munster,
and impregnated a number of Germans with his religious
phrenzy, which aimed at the demolition of the doctrine of Luther:
this fanatic faction spread with incredible celerity, until the Elector
of Saxony, the Landgrave of Hesse, and the duke of Brunswick,
resolved upon drawing the sword against these furious zealots.
The prophet Munster was taken prisoner and lost his head; but
soon after, as if inspirited by this blow, John of Leyden took Munster
at the head of a troop of sanguinary bigots, and ordered himself to be
proclaimed king. After this ceremony was performed he committed
the most horrible outrages: in the name of God, he battered
down all the churches, and changed the religion of the country;
he recommended polygamy, and kept a seraglio of sixteen wives,
one of whom endeavoured to assassinate the Bishop of Waldeck,
who fortunately seized the poniard from her hand, and plunged
it into her own bosom; and another, John himself put to death
for hesitation in complying with his wishes. When he appeared
in the streets of Munster, he wore a crown upon his head, carried
a sword in one hand, and the New Testament in the other, and
was preceded on horseback by a group of dancing boys, whilst the
sides were by his mandates, crowded with the prostrate terrified
citizens, who were punished with instant death if they stood, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>remained covered in his presence. The reign of this petty tyrant
was brief: the Bishop of Munster besieged the town, which suffered
nearly the same horrors which I have described to have occurred
at Leyden, when the Spaniards sat down before it; the living
fed upon the dead, and a look that intimated a wish to surrender
was punished with instant death. The miseries which surrounded
him, served only to inflame the fanatical spirit of the monster; at
last, however, the town was taken by surprise, and John and the
ministers of his bloody ambition were conducted before the victorious
prelate, to whom, after being charged with the enormities
which he had committed, he is said to have replied, with the craft
of a coward, in the following manner: “The possession of my
person has cost you much money and much blood, my death will
be a loss to you, my life may become a source of profit to you,
put me in an iron cage, set a price upon the exhibition of me, and
send me through Europe, thus will you in the end be the gainer
by me.” The bishop saw through his object which was the dastard
preservation of his forfeited life, and accordingly ordered him
to be put to death with a refinement of cruelty, at the relation of
which human nature sickens, abhorred as the victim was. Two
executioners tore his flesh slowly asunder with red hot pincers,
and after the mitred conqueror and his followers had glutted their
eyes with his writhings, and their ears with his screams, a javelin
pierced his heart, and his mangled body was thrown into a cage,
and exposed to the birds of the air from the steeple of St. Lambert’s
church. It has been observed by some travellers, that the
Dutch are much given to a tremulous motion of the head. I saw
no instance of this national trait except, where I expected to find
it, among old and paralytic persons. The practice of bowing is
not confined to the Dutchman, though adduced against him as a
sort of blemish by every Englishman who extends his rambles no
farther than Holland: throughout Germany the same courtesy is
displayed, and even among the common Russian boors the practice
of exchanging bows is quite common.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was not much gratified with the church of St. Peter, the
principal one in the city; it is a large ponderous building, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>worst style of gothic architecture. In this structure the English and
Russian soldiers were confined when taken prisoners at Alkmaar.
The poor Russians, who expected no quarter, looked upon the
brass chandeliers which are suspended in the body of the church,
as the instruments of execution, to each of which they thought of
being fastened by the neck. The Russians, in their first campaigns
with the French, entertained the same apprehension, and were
most agreeably astonished on one occasion, which presented a
memorable display of French sagacity, to find that, instead of being
shot or guillotined, they were presented with new clothing of
the Russian uniform, and offered their liberty.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>In the streets of Leyden are several very handsome bookseller’s
shops, particularly Murray’s in the Braadstraat, where there
are many valuable publications, and particularly a fine collection
of the classics, which are sold at very reasonable prices. The press
of Leyden, in the time of Elzevirs, presented some of the most
elegant specimens of typography, in the many correct and beautiful
editions which they have given of the most renowned authors
of antiquity. In beauty, variety, and profusion, the Leyden press
rivalled, and in many instances surpassed, that of the Hague and
Amsterdam; but since the period of the above bibliopolists, it has
gradually decayed. It may be easily imagined, that with the change
which has taken place in the political relations of Holland, the
liberty of the press is not what it used to be at Leyden, which
was once celebrated for its Gazette, a rival in reputation of that of
Brussels: the former was distinguished for its partiality to the
Stadtholder, and his well known attachments to the English cabinet;
and the latter for supporting the true interests of the country.
The editors and proprietors of the Leyden Gazette fled with precipitation,
on the irruption of the French into Holland; and the
paper which is now issued from Leyden, is of course the organ of
the new government, and but little enlivened with political discussion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>The staple trade of Leyden, the woollen manufactory, has suffered
very severely from the establishment of extensive looms in
various parts of Germany, from the last and present war with
England, and from the superiority of the manufactures of Yorkshire,
which are in such high estimation in America and Asia,
that Dutch merchants trading to those countries, found it more
advantageous to send out English cloths. The coarse cloths of
Holland had formerly a brisk market amongst the East and West
India Companies: but from the above cause thousands of manufacturers
have been obliged to renounce their looms, and divert their
skill and industry to other sources of support; and in all human
probability the woollen manufactures of Leyden will never revive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before I quit this celebrated city, I cannot help mentioning that,
in addition to the illustrious artists before mentioned, it gave birth
to Gerard Douw, who was born here in 1613, and entered at the
early age of fifteen into the school of Rembrandt, with whom he
continued three years, and from whom he obtained the true principles
of colouring: his pictures are generally small, and remarkable
for their wonderful brilliancy, delicacy, transparency, and exquisite
high finishing. Sandrart relates a curious anecdote of the
laborious assiduity which he displayed. Being with Bamboccio in
the painting-room of Gerard Douw, they were enraptured with
the wonderful minuteness of a picture which Douw was then
painting, and were particularly struck with the finishing of a
broom, and could not refrain expressing their surprise at the
amazing neatness displayed in so minute an object; upon which
Douw informed them that he should spend three more days upon
that very broom before he could complete it to his satisfaction.
The same author also relates, that in a family picture of a Mrs.
Spiering, Douw occupied five days in finishing one of the hands
that leaned over an arm-chair. This disposition to elaborate execution,
in which he far surpassed every other Flemish master,
so alarmed a great number of persons, that they had not patience
to sit to him, and hence he chiefly applied his fine powers in works
of fancy, in which he could introduce objects of still-life, and gratify
his inclination in the choice of his time. A noble instance is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>related of the liberality of his great patron, Mr. Spiering, the
husband of the lady above-mentioned, resident of the king of
Sweden at the Hague, namely, that he allowed him a thousand
guilders a year, with no other stipulation than that Douw should
give his benefactor the preference of purchasing every picture he
painted, for which he always paid him to the full extent of his
demand. He lived to a great age, but his sight was so affected by
the minuteness of his performances that at the age of thirty he
was obliged to use spectacles. The finest picture from his hands
considerably exceeded his usual size, being three feet high by two
feet six inches broad within the frame: this matchless piece of art
represents two rooms; in the first there appears a very curious
piece of tapestry, forming the separation of the apartments, in
which there is a very pretty-figure of a woman with a child at her
breast; at her side is a cradle, and a table covered with tapestry,
on which is placed a gilt lamp and some pieces of still-life; in the
second apartment is a surgeon’s shop, with a countryman undergoing
an operation, and a woman standing by him with several
utensils: the folding doors show on one side a study, and a man
making a pen by candlelight, and on the other side, a school with
boys writing, and sitting at different tables, which parts are lighted
in a most charming and astonishing manner, so that every feature
and character of countenance is distinctly, and most intelligibly
delineated. Incredible sums have been given, and still continue
to be given for the works of this master, in his own country, and
in every polite part of Europe where they are to be found. Some
of his best works are now in the royal gallery at Dresden.</p>

<p class='c007'>I must not omit that comical, dissipated humourist and happy
artist, Jan Steen, who was born here in 1636, whose wit and drollery
were only surpassed by his wonderful powers in painting, in which
such was his astonishing faculty, that he seemed to be more inspired
than instructed, for he kept an alehouse for a considerable
time, from the cellars of which he drew more for himself than for
his customers, and having exhausted his barrels, he replenished
them by the product of his art, to which he never devoted himself
but upon such occasions, and generally discharged the bills of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>the brewers and wine merchants with pictures. Although he
might have lived in great affluence by his masterly pencil, he was
frequently reduced to the most deplorable penury by indolence
and dissipation; his faces alone completely indicated the rank and
condition of the person depicted. Great prices are now given for
the works of this artist, though they sold for small sums in his
life time, on account of his being obliged to sell upon the pressure
of necessity. A characteristic anecdote is related of this singular
artist. In a picture of the crucifixion, having introduced a numerous
group of figures, consisting of monks, old women, and dogs,
at the foot of the cross, he was asked to explain the reason of such
an assemblage; to which he replied, “the clergy and the old women
are always the most eager in their inquiries, when any thing
curious occurs.” Some years since, another instance of his eccentric
turn of mind was sold for a considerable sum at Amsterdam,
viz. a painting of the deluge, which he had delineated by introducing
a large Dutch cheese, with the word Leyden inscribed upon
it, floating in the centre of a sheet of water, which, he said, would
incontestably prove that all the world was drowned. The name of
Jan Steen naturally introduces that of his great friend Francis
Mieres, who was born here in 1635, and was a pupil of Gerard
Douw, who, from the rapid progress he made in his studies, used
to call him the Prince of his Disciples: in rich transparency, an
unusual sweetness of colouring, and an elaborate but delicate
touch, he nearly approached his illustrious master. Mieres was
generally paid a ducat an hour for his works, and the Grand Duke
of Tuscany paid him no less than a thousand rix dollars for one
picture. Unfortunately for this artist, he conceived an uncommon
friendship for the drunken, droll Jan Steen, which frequently involved
him in inconvenience, and disgrace. An anecdote is related
of Mieres, in consequence of this association, which in its result
did much honour to his feelings; being accustomed to pass whole
nights with his friend in the most joyous manner at a tavern, he
was returning home very late one evening from his company,
when he fell into a common sewer, which had been left open in
order to cleanse it, where he must have perished, had not a cobler
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and his wife, who were in a neighbouring stall, heard his cries, and
instantly ran to his relief; having extricated him, although they
were total strangers to him, they took care of him for the night,
and treated him with all the kindness in their power: the next
morning their guest returned to his lodgings, strongly impressed
with the humanity and hospitality of his new friends,
whom he resolved to reward in a manner worthy of their conduct;
and accordingly having painted a picture in his best manner, he
returned to his preservers and presented them with it, telling them
it was the production of a person whose life they had preserved,
and directed them to go and offer it to his friend and patron Cornelius
Plaats, who would give the full value for it. The woman,
unacquainted with the real value of the present, expected only a
moderate gratuity for the picture, and was overwhelmed with surprise
when the liberal purchaser paid her eight hundred florins for
it. The grand Duke of Tuscany offered three thousand florins for
a picture of Mieres, representing a lady fainting, and a physician
relieving her. Francis Mieres left two sons and a grandson, all of
whom were distinguished artists. John Van Goyen the father-in-law
of Jan Steen, was also an artist of great celebrity: he painted
a great number of pictures, and his execution was marvellously
rapid, of which the following curious anecdote is recorded as a
memorable instance: Hoogstraten relates that Van Goyen, Knipbergen,
and Parcelles, had agreed each to paint a picture in one
day, in the presence of several other artists, their friends, to whose
judgment was left the disposal of a considerable sum of money subscribed
for that purpose by the contending artists, to be bestowed
upon the person who produced the best picture within that period.
As soon as Van Goyen took the pencil, without making any previous
sketch, he first laid on the light colour of the sky, then he rubbed on
several different shades of brown, next masses of light on the foreground
in several spots; out of this chaos, he produced trees, buildings,
water, distant hills, vessels lying before a sea-port, and boats
filled with figures, with almost magical celerity, and exquisite
spirit, and finished the whole within the limited time, to the astonishment
of the beholders. Knipbergen proceeded with his work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>in quite a different manner, for instead of beginning to colour his
canvass he sketched on his palette the design he had formed in
his imagination, and took much pains to give it all imaginable
correctness, every rock, tree, waterfall, and other object, was
disposed in the manner it was intended to be finished in the
painting, and he attempted nothing more than to transfer the
sketch upon the canvass; this picture was also finished in the time,
and was allowed by the observers to possess much merit. The
method observed by Parcelles differed from both, for when he took
up his palette and pencils, he sat a long time in deep meditation
upon his subject, and having arranged his thoughts, he executed
within the time also, a sea-piece, admirably designed and delicately
finished. The judges were unanimous in deciding for Parcelles,
observing, that though the pictures of Van Goyen and Knipbergen
were full of spirit, taste, and good colouring, yet in the picture by
Parcelles there was equal merit as well in the handling as the
colouring, and more truth, as being the result of great thought
and judicious premeditation. William Vandervelde, the celebrated
marine painter, was also born here in 1610: the love of his art
induced him to remove with his family to England, on account of
the superior elegance in the construction of British ships; and he
was successively patronised by King Charles II. and King James
II. Such was his enthusiasm, that, in order to unite fidelity with
grandeur and elegance in his compositions, he would boldly
advance in a small light vessel into the very heat of a naval
engagement, and make his sketches, in undaunted tranquillity,
whilst the balls were flying about him in all directions. Of this
bold spirit he exhibited two very memorable instances, before he
came to England; one was in the severe battle between the Duke
of York and Admiral Opdam, in which the Dutch admiral and
503 men were blown up; and the other, in that great battle, which
lasted three days, between Admiral Monck and Admiral de
Ruyter, during which engagements Vandervelde plied between
the fleets, so that he was enabled to represent every movement of
the ships, and every material circumstance of the action, with astonishing
minuteness and truth. There were formerly some good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>private collections of paintings in this city, but the political storms
of the country have dispersed them.</p>

<p class='c007'>About a mile from Leyden there is a very valuable collection
by some of the most distinguished Dutch and Flemish masters,
belonging to Mr. Gevers, who has a noble mansion, and grounds
very tastefully disposed; and who upon all occasions is happy to
permit strangers to visit his cabinet, and to show them every hospitality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Near this city, in the village of Rhynsburg, the assembly of a
very singular and equally liberal religious association is held, the
members of which are called after the name of the place, Rhynsburgians:
this meeting was established by three peasants, who
were brothers, of the name of John, Adrian, and Gilbert Van Code,
who to an excellent and profitable acquaintance with farming,
which they followed, singularly united a profound knowledge of
languages, for which they were so celebrated, that Prince Maurice,
and Monsieur de Maurier, the then French ambassador, honoured
them with several visits, and conversed with them in Latin, Greek,
Italian, and French, in each of which they astonished their visitors
by their fluency and pronunciation: another brother, William,
filled the professorship of the oriental languages in the university
of Leyden. In consequence of the churches being left without their
pastors, on the expulsion of the remonstrant clergy in the year
1619, the three first-mentioned brothers determined to supply
their places, and undertook to explain the Scriptures: they set an
example of genuine christianity which has been rarely displayed;
and they taught that every one had a right to worship God according
to his own form of faith, taking the Bible for his guide. This
association meet every Saturday, for the purpose of digesting the
discourses of the ensuing Sunday, when, with the sincerest humility,
one of the fraternity distributes the bread and wine. After the
morning duties of the Sabbath are passed, they reassemble in the
evening to return thanks to the Almighty for his favours, and at the
same time particularize the instances of his goodness. On Monday
morning they part to attend to their different temporal concerns,
and at their taking leave, solemnly impress upon each other the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>sacred obligation, and the blissful result of a perseverance in the
pious course which they have hitherto pursued. Such benevolent
and exalted principles attract persons of various persuasions to the
meeting, who assist in its solemnities, and partake in the pure spirit
of its devotion. The religion most followed previous to the revolution,
was the presbyterian and calvinistical; before the revolution,
none but presbyterians were admitted into any office or post under
government, except in the army. The republic, in its early stages,
displayed its wisdom in making the calvinistical persuasion predominant,
for the country at that period was too poor to erect magnificent
temples of worship, and support a train of prelates in the
splendor bestowed upon them in other countries, which were more
rich, and had a population adequate to the cultivation of the soil.
It was of the highest consequence to Holland to encourage population,
and they could not more effectually do it, than by a policy
equally generous and enlightened, which offered an asylum to all
foreigners persecuted for their religion, and discouraged all monastic
institutions.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I was one day roving in this city, I was struck with the
appearance of a small board ornamented with a considerable quantity
of lace, with an inscription on it, fastened to a house: upon
inquiry, I found that the lady of the mansion, where I saw it, had
lately lain in, and was then much indisposed, and that it was the
custom of the country to expose this board, which contained an
account of the state of the invalid’s health, for the satisfaction of
her inquiring friends, who were by this excellent plan informed
of her situation, without disturbing her by knocking at the door,
and by personal inquiries: the lace I found was never displayed
but in lying in cases, but without it, this sort of bulletin is frequently
used in other cases of indisposition amongst persons of
consequence.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a painful task not to be able to close my account of this
beautiful and celebrated city, without lamenting with the reader
the dreadful accident which befel it on the 12th of January last,
more terrible and destructive than all the horrors of its siege, the
intelligence of which was communicated to me very soon afterwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>by a friend in Holland, just as I had fairly written out thus
far of my journal. About one o’clock of that day, a vessel laden
with forty thousand pounds weight of gunpowder from Amsterdam,
destined for Delft, and then lying in the Rapenburg canal, by
some means which can never now be known, took fire and blew
up with the explosion of a mighty volcano, by which many hundreds
of lives were lost, and a great portion of the city destroyed.
The king, on hearing of the dreadful catastrophe was sensibly affected,
repaired to the city, remained all the following night in
the streets, and was to be seen wherever his presence could animate
the survivors to stop the progress of the flames, to clear the
rubbish of falling buildings, and drag from under the ruins those
who had been covered by them: the king offered the palace in
the wood to persons of respectability, whose habitations had been
overthrown by the shock, until they could secure homes to repair
to; empowered the magistrates of this devoted city to make a
general collection throughout the whole kingdom, and ordered
100,000 guilders to be paid out of the treasury for the relief of
the surviving sufferers.</p>

<p class='c007'>I quitted Leyden with great reluctance, and entered on board
the treckschuyt for Haarlem, which sets off every two hours for
that town, distant from Leyden fifteen miles. The canal all the
way is broad and clear, and frequently adorned with the yellow fringed
water-lily. Nothing could be more beautiful than our passage.
As we approached Haarlem, the villas and gardens which
nearly all the way adorned the banks of the canal, increased in
number, beauty, and magnitude: many of them belong to the
most opulent merchants of Amsterdam. Haarlem is not so beautiful
as Leyden, but abounds with spacious streets, canals, avenues,
and handsome houses: it is about four miles from the sea,
and fifteen from Amsterdam: on one side of the canal is the Haarlem
meer, or lake, the spring water of which is so celebrated all
over Europe for producing the most brilliant whiteness upon the
linens bleached here, and the superior property of which cannot
be reached by any chymical process. Haarlem was once fortified,
but its ramparts now form an agreeable promenade. The bleacheries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>of this city are too well known to be further mentioned; in all
his wandering, the traveller will never enjoy the luxury of snow-white
linen in such perfection as at Haarlem: before the war,
Scotch and Irish linens used to be sent here to be bleached. There
was a considerable manufacture of silks and camblets, but it has
experienced a great decline, and the principal trade is bleaching
threads and cambric; the inhabitants are calculated at thirty-two
thousand. The cathedral, which is said to be the largest in the
kingdom, though I am inclined to think that of Utrecht greater,
was built in 1472, and the steeple, which is very handsome, was
added in 1515. To inspect the internal part of the building, I was
obliged to apply to one of the principal clergymen belonging to it,
who resides in an adjoining house, and attended by a lady-like
looking woman, perhaps his wife, or house-keeper, I was admitted
into this venerable pile, where the first object that struck me was
the celebrated organ supported upon pillars of porphyry: this instrument
is said to be the finest and largest in the world; it occupies
the whole west end of the nave. For a ducat paid to the organist,
and two florins to the bellows blower, the former will gratify the
traveller by playing for an hour; unfortunately for me he was absent
in the country, and I did not hear the celebrated vox humana,
or pipe, which most admirably imitates the human voice. Of the
magnitude of this enormous musical pile, the reader may form
some conception when he is informed that it contains eight thousand
pipes, some of which are thirty-eight feet in length, and sixteen
inches in diameter, and has sixty-four stops, four separations,
two shakes, two couplings, and twelve bellows; like an elephant,
that with his proboscis can either pluck a violet or raise a tree by
its roots, the notes of this wonderful instrument can swell from
the softest to the sublimest sounds, from the warbling of a distant
bird to the awful tone of thunder, until the massy building trembles
in all its aisles. On every Tuesday and Thursday, a voluntary
is played upon this organ from twelve till one o’clock, when the
doors of the cathedral are thrown open. Many years since the immortal
Handel played upon this organ, when the organist, in
amazement, pronounced him to be an angel, or the devil. Between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>two of the columns which support the organ, there is a noble emblematical
alto-relievo, with three figures as large as life, by Xavery,
representing Gratitude, assisted by Poetry and Music, making
an offering to Piety, and a Latin inscription purporting that
the organ was erected in 1738, at the town’s expense, the same
having been built by Christian Muller of this city. This is the
organ which the good people of Rotterdam are endeavouring to
rival: the cathedral, like the other churches, is crowded with
square wooden monuments, painted with the arms of the deceased
on a black ground, with the date of their death in gold letters, but
no names: in the wall at the east end of the church, a cannon ball
is exhibited, which was fired into it by the Spaniards in the sixteenth
century, during divine service.</p>

<p class='c007'>The walks round this city are very beautiful, and at a short
distance from it there is a noble wood, in which is a fine walk of
stately elms, nearly three miles long, abounding with beautiful
scenery: this wood is a rival of that which I have described at the
Hague. In this delightful place stands the mansion of Mr. Henry
Hope, whose family has been long known for its loyalty and immense
wealth: it is said to have cost fifty thousand pounds. Upon
the revolution taking place, this gentleman was obliged to seek refuge
in England, to the capital of which he had previously transported
in safety his magnificent collection of paintings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The villa, which is built of brick stuccoed, is modern and
magnificent, and before the revolution was frequently resorted to
by the Prince of Orange and his family, who were much attached
to its opulent and liberal owner, which he eminently merited, by
having rendered them many important services, particularly in
1788, when it was unsafe for him to appear on the exchange of
Amsterdam without military protection. As the pictures were removed,
there was nothing in the internal part of the mansion worthy
of notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Haarlem and its environs are more celebrated than any other
spot, for the beautiful flowers which it produces, the soil being peculiarly
propitious to their production.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Not far from the church, the spot where stood the house of
Lawrence Coster, who lived in the middle of the fifteenth century,
the celebrated inventor of the art of printing, is shewn; formerly
there was a statue over the gate where he lived, within this inscription:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The first book he printed is kept in the town house, in a silver
case wrapt up in silk, and is always shewn with great caution, as a
most precious relic of antiquity. The glory of this transcendent
discovery, which spread light and civilization over the world, and
formed a new epoch in its history, was for a long time disputed
between Haarlem, Mayence, and Strasburg: the latter, after a laborious
investigation, has renounced her pretensions, and the general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>opinion seems to bestow the palm upon the first city. The manner
in which Coster imbibed the first impressions of this divine discovery,
is said to have been from his cutting the letters of his name
on the bark of a tree, and afterwards pressing a piece of paper upon
the characters, until they became legible upon it, which induced
him to continue the experiment, by engraving other letters upon
wood. Those early principles were soon diffused through France,
with considerable improvements, by the enterprising ability of the
Etiennes; by the learned Manutius, a celebrated Venetian painter,
and the inventor of Italian characters, through Italy; and through
the Netherlands by Christopher Plantin, whose printing office at
Antwerp was one of the principal ornaments of the town, and who
was distinguished for his skill, erudition, and prodigious wealth,
created solely by a successful prosecution of his important business.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mayence contests the honour of the invention, but it is generally
believed that a servant of Coster, of the name of Faustus,
stole the types of his master on a Christmas-eve, whilst he was attending
his devotions at church, and fled with his booty to Mayence.
The portrait of Coster is to be seen in most of the booksellers’
shops at Haarlem, and in other principal towns.</p>

<p class='c007'>A memorable, but not an unusual instance of affection, and of
female presence of mind, occurred in this city many years since,
at a spot which is still shown with no little degree of national pride,
whereon an ancient castle stood, the lord of which was severely
pressed by the burghers of the town, who laid siege to it, on account
of his tyrannical conduct towards them: driven to the last
extremity, and when his life was upon the point of paying the forfeit
of his crimes, his lady appeared on the ramparts, and offered
to surrender, provided she might be permitted to bring out as
much of <em>her most valuable goods as she could carry on her back</em>;
which being complied with, she brought her husband out upon
her shoulders, preserved him from the fury of the troops, and gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>up to them possession of the castle: thinking in the language of

<p class='c007'>History informs us, that Haarlem presented a glorious example
of resistance to the Spanish yoke, so heroically imitated two
years afterwards at Leyden, which experienced a better fortune
than befel the wretched inhabitants of the former city. Whilst the
provinces were bravely opposing their invaders, a long and memorable
siege in 1573, which was carried on against Haarlem by
Frederic of Toledo, the son of the sanguinary Duke of Alva, during
which the female inhabitants, like those of Leyden, assisted
the garrison in their duties, underwent every privation, faced every
horror, and rushed to certain destruction in defence of the town,
with an alacrity and fortitude which have rendered them immortal
in the annals of their country. Those heroines, when the garrison
refused with indignation the conditions which were offered
them by the Spanish general, fought with unshaken courage by
the side of the men, in their desperate sorties against the besieging
army, and in their fury put every prisoner to death, whom they
took in these attacks. This unjustifiable conduct, and the derision
which from the ramparts they expressed of the Roman Catholic
worship, induced the Spaniards to retort with terrible vengeance.
In consequence of a correspondence which the besieged carried
on with the Prince of Orange by means of carrier pigeons,
being discovered by the Spaniards, they shot every pigeon
which came within the reach of their musketry, which rendered
the situation of the garrison hopeless, and they at length surrendered,
on condition that the lives of the soldiers and inhabitants
should be spared, to which Frederic of Toledo consented, entered
the town at the head of his victorious troops, and in cold blood
butchered two thousand of those who had submitted to his arms,
and trusted to his honour.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>When it is considered, that at this period, the Spanish monarchy
was predominant in Europe, that its armies were mighty,
its generals experienced, and its treasury overflowing, the triumphant
prowess which the Dutch displayed in finally driving their
powerful invaders back to their own frontiers, will render the
Dutch name illustrious as long as the record of history endures.
The Dutch ladies have rivalled in fame the most renowned heroines
of Greece and Rome. The Hollanders treasure up these
gallant exploits in their memories, they form the favourite subjects
of their songs, and the old and the young recite with enthusiasm
the great deeds of their ancestors.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Haarlem lake which I mentioned, presented a very bleak
and dismal sheet of water from the canal; it is about fourteen miles
long, and about the same number broad, is said to be above six
feet deep, and lies between Leyden, Amsterdam, and Haarlem:
its waters are slimy, and abound with eels, some of which are of
a prodigious size. This lake can have no charm but for a bleacher.
The fuel used here is Newcastle coals and turf.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having described what is worthy of notice at Haarlem, it would
be indifference indeed to an art which I worship, were I to quit this
city without briefly adverting to some of the principal distinguished
artists which it had the honour of giving birth to. The first in
chronological order was Philip Wouvermans, who was born at
Haarlem in 1620, whose sweetness of colouring, correctness of
design, beautiful choice of scenery, and perfect knowledge of the
chiaro-scuro, or as it has well been defined, of light and black, have
excited the admiration and applause of posterity: the subjects
which he was particularly partial to were huntings, hawkings,
encampments of armies, farriers’ shops, and all those scenes that
admitted of his introducing horses, which he painted to great perfection.
Notwithstanding his transcendent merit, for a considerable
period he met with no encouragement, and encountered many
difficulties which greatly depressed his spirits, of which the picture-merchants
knew how to take every ungenerous advantage: at
length he was relieved from his indigence and dependence, by the
bounty of his confessor, who seeing his uncommon genius, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>resolved to the extent of his power, to extricate it from the odious
shackles which encumbered it, and accordingly advanced him six
hundred guilders, by a judicious application of which he emancipated
himself from his embarrassments: he now doubled the
price of his pictures, and was enabled to give his daughter a
marriage portion of twenty thousand guilders. As soon as he was
enabled to pay his confessor, he sent the sum he had borrowed,
accompanied with a chef-d’œuvre of his works, representing his
holy benefactor in the character of St. Hubert kneeling before his
horse. All connoisseurs agree that this picture is the finest he ever
painted. Wouvermans resided in the Bakenessegragt, a short distance
from the church. The depression of mind which his early disappointments
excited, never quitted this great artist: a few hours
before he died, he ordered a box filled with his studies and designs
to be burned, saying, “I was so long unrewarded for my labours,
that I wish to prevent my son from being allured by these designs,
to embrace so unpromising and uncertain a profession as mine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The works of Wouvermans and Bamboccio were continually
placed in competition by the best judges of art, and the latter having
painted a picture which was much admired, John de Wilt prevailed
upon Wouvermans to paint the same subject, which he executed
in a brilliant manner: these pictures were soon afterwards
exhibited together to the public, and De Wilt, when the room
in which they were placed, was exceedingly crowded, exclaimed
in a loud voice, “all our connoisseurs seem to prefer the works of
those painters who have studied at Rome; but behold how far the
work of Wouvermans who never saw Rome, surpasses the production
of him who resided there several years.” This observation,
which was received with general approbation, and seemed to receive
the fiat of the company, so deeply affected the delicate spirits
of Bamboccio, that it largely contributed to hurry him to his grave.</p>

<p class='c007'>The justly celebrated Nicholas Berghem, was born here in
1624, and studied under his father, an inconsiderable painter,
whose name was Van Haarlem, which Berghem exchanged in the
following whimsical manner: whilst he was a pupil of John Van
Goyen, who was very fond of him, his father was one day pursuing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>him in the street, to give him correction for some peccadillo, when
his master seeing his father gaining upon him rapidly, cried out
to some of his other scholars, Berg-hem! which signifies hide him;
from which circumstance he obtained and kept that name. The distinguishing
characteristics of Berghem’s pictures are breadth, and
just distribution of the lights, the grandeur of his masses of light
and shadow, the natural attitudes of his figures expressive of their
several characters, the just gradation of his distances, the brilliancy,
harmony, and transparency of his colouring, the correctness and
true perspective of his design, and the elegance of his composition,
and his subjects however various are all equally admirable. This
great man had the calamity and the infatuation to make an offer
of his hand and heart to the daughter of one of the masters under
whom he studied, when he left Van Goyen, of the name of Willis,
who proved to be one of the most clamorous and sordid termagants
that Holland, or perhaps any other country ever produced;
by the terror of her tongue, and the fury of her manner, she
forced him to slave at his easel without intermission, from the
break to the departure of day, and frequently all night long, without
permitting him to have the disposal of a single guilder without
her consent: amidst this domestic broil, poor Berghem never
lost his temper, he sung, whilst she scolded, as if he thought</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And do you tell me of a woman’s tongue,</div>
      <div class='line'>That gives not half so great a blow to hear</div>

      <div class='line in16'><cite>Taming of the Shrew</cite>, Act I. Scene 3.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In this increasing state of internal broil, this artist produced
some of the finest effusions of his pencil: he was singularly curious
in purchasing the finest prints and designs of the Italian masters,
to improve his own taste, which after his death sold for a
large sum of money: by his indefatigable industry, he produced
an amazing number of pictures, which now are rarely to be purchased,
and then only for prodigious prices.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last that I shall mention is Jacob Ruysdaal, who was born
here in 1636, and was the bosom friend of Berghem, who imparted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>to him much of the spirit which adorns his own works. No
painter ever possessed a greater share of public admiration than
Ruysdaal, a reputation which has remained unimpaired to this
hour. His works are distinguishable by a natural and most delightful
tone of colour, by a free, light, firm, and spirited pencil,
and by a happy choice of situation. He was fond of introducing
water into his paintings, and he was equally fortunate in representing
the tumultuous foam of the torrent, as the pellucid transparency
of the canal. Ruysdaal was cut off at the age of forty-five.
Since the removal of Mr. Hope’s collection, there is no private
cabinet of pictures in or near Haarlem worth the attention of the
traveller. There is, however, a cabinet of natural history, said to be
the finest in Holland, which was formed by Doctor Van Marum,
whose electrical experiments have ascertained that the death of
animals is coincident with the cessation of irritability: this museum
is well arranged according to the Linnæan system. I heard of
nothing more to detain the traveller at Haarlem. The canal from
Haarlem to Amsterdam is clear and spacious, and nearly straight
for the first four miles, at the lessening end of which the former
city has a very agreeable appearance; but I was surprised to find
so very few country-houses, and scarcely an object that denoted
our approach to the renowned capital of the kingdom, and, as it has
been aptly called, “the great warehouse of the world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>About half way we changed boats, and crossed the enormous
sluices which protect the country from inundation in this part: we
passed over the waters of the Haarlem Meer and of the river Y,
so called from its form resembling that letter, being a branch of
the Zuyder Zee. The only object worthy of notice thus far was a
large stone building, called the Castle Zwanenburg, the residence
of the directors of the dykes and water-works of Rhynland. The
cost of constructing and repairing the sluices is paid out of the
general taxes. The country here is four or five feet below the level
of the river Y, which, however, is rendered perfectly innocuous
by the massy and prodigious dams before mentioned, the construction
and preservation of which place the indefatigable enterprise
and industry of the Hollander in an eminent point of view.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>I reached Amsterdam just after the gates had been closed, but
my commissaire and I were admitted upon paying a few stivers.
As soon as we had entered, every object denoted a vast, populous,
and opulent city: every street, and I passed through a great number
before I reached my hotel, was tolerably well lighted, but in
this respect infinitely inferior to London. At length, after traversing
the city about two miles and a half, I reached the principal
hotel, called Amsterdam Wappen, or the Arms of Amsterdam,
which, in point of magnitude and accommodation, may vie with
the first hotels in our own metropolis. Here, after an excellent
supper of fish, which the Dutch dress to admiration, and some
porter, which was an excellent imitation of that description of beverage
for which London is so justly renowned, I found a sopha
bed prepared for me, with curtains pendent from the centre, in
the French taste, which much prevails in the internal arrangement
of the houses of this great city.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the morning I was awakened by the chimes of some of the
churches, which in softness and sweetness resembled the distant
sounds of a harp. Although it was seven o’clock, upon looking
from the window, I heard the hum and beheld the bustle of business
which in other countries characterise mid-day. Under the
agreeable influence of a brilliant, cloudless sky, I descended into
the street, and mingled with the active, ant-like multitude, every
member of which presented a physiognomy full of thought and
calculation: gold, gold, seemed to be the only object:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The first circumstance that afforded novelty was, that amidst
all the bustle I seldom met with any carriages on wheels to augment
the noise of the scene. Upon enquiry I found, that, by the
police laws of Amsterdam, wheel-carriages are limited to a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>number, which is very inconsiderable compared with the size of
the city, from an apprehension that an uncontrouled use of them
might hazard the foundation of the houses, most of which are
built upon piles; for nearly the whole of the ground on which this
vast city stands was formerly a morass. A carriage, called by the
Dutch a sley, and by the French a traineau, or, on account of its
solemnity, un pot de chambre, is used in their room; it is the body
of a coach fastened by ropes on a sledge, and drawn by one horse;
the driver walks by the side of it, which he holds with one hand to
prevent its falling over, and with the other the reins: nothing can
be more melancholy than this machine, which holds four persons,
moves at the rate of about three miles an hour, and seems more
like the equipage of an hospital, than a vehicle in which the observer
would expect to find a merry face; yet in this manner do the
Dutch frequently pay visits and take the air. It was in allusion to
the forest foundation of this wonderful place, that Erasmus sportively
observed, when he first visited it, that he had reached a city,
the inhabitants of which, like crows, lived upon the tops of trees;
and another wit compared Amsterdam to Venice, on account of
both having wooden legs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Amsterdam is situated on the rivers Y and Amstel, from the
latter of which it derives its name; it is about nine miles and a half
in circumference, of a semicircular form, surrounded with a fosse
about eighty feet wide, and a rampart faced with brick, which is
in several places dismantled, and twenty-six bastions: it has also
eight noble gates of stone, and several draw-bridges: the population
is estimated at three hundred thousand. In 1204, with the exception
of a small castle, not a building was to be seen upon the scite
of this great city, which, from being at first a petty village of fishermen,
dilated in the lapse of years, and by the enterprise and industry
of the inhabitants, into a magnificent capital, which, at
length, upon the shutting up of the navigation of the Scheldt,
added the commerce of Antwerp to its own, and became the great
emporium of the world. Neither here, nor in any of the cities or
towns in Holland, through which I passed, is a stranger annoyed
by barriers, productions of passports, or any of those disagreeable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>ceremonies which distinguish the police of many other countries.
In Holland a foreigner finds his loco-motive disposition as little restricted,
or encumbered by municipal regulations, as in England.
Canals intersect nearly the whole of this city, adorned with avenues
of stately elms. Many of the houses are very splendid, particularly
those in Kiezer’s gragt, or Emperor’s street, and Heeren
gragt, or Lords’ street, where there are many mansions, which,
were they not so much concealed by the fan of the trees before
them, would have a very princely appearance. Many of the shops
are also very handsome, particularly those belonging to jewellers
and print-sellers; in the windows of the latter prints of the illustrious
Nelson, and of our marine victories, were exposed to view,
The druggists here, and in other parts of Holland, use as a sign a
huge carved head, with the mouth wide open, placed before the
shop windows; sometimes it rudely resembles a Mercury’s head,
at others it is surmounted by a fool’s cap. This clumsy and singular
sign is called de gaaper, the gaper; what analogy it bears to
physic I could not learn; it is very likely to have originated in whim
and caprice. Some of the shop boards, called uithang borden, have
ridiculous verses inscribed upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first place my curiosity led me to was the Stadt-house,
which is unquestionably a wonderful edifice, considering that Holland
furnishes no stone, and that the foundation of the building
was boggy; the latter circumstance rendered it necessary to have
an artificial foundation of extraordinary construction and magnitude,
and accordingly it rests upon thirteen thousand six hundred
and ninety-five massy trees, or piles, the first of which was driven
on the 20th of January, 1648, and the last on the 6th of October
following, when the first stone, with a suitable inscription, was
laid; and seven years afterwards the different colleges of magistrates
took formal possession of the apartments allotted for their
respective offices, but at this time the roof and dome were not completed:
the expense of this mighty edifice amounted to two millions
sterling. The principal architect was John Van Kampen,
who acted under the control of four burgomasters. The area in
which it stands is spacious, and was till lately called Revolutie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>plein; it is disfigured by the proximity of the waag, or weigh-house,
a very old shabby building. The form of the Stadt-house
is square, its front is two hundred and eighty-two feet, its depth
two hundred and fifty-five, and its height one hundred and sixteen.
It has seven small porticoes, representative of the seven provinces;
the want of a grand entrance is a great architectural defect, which
immediately excites the surprise of the traveller; but it was so
constructed from the wary precautionary foresight of the magistrates
who had the superintendence of the building, for the purpose
of preventing free access to a mob, in case of tumult.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the first apartments which attracts the attention is the
tribunal, on the basement floor; in this room, prisoners who have
been found guilty of capital offences are conducted to receive the
awful sentence of the law; the entrance is through a massy folding
door, decorated with brass emblems, indicative of the purpose to
which the chamber is applied, such as Jove’s beams of lightning,
and flaming swords—under which are two lines from Virgil,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la">Discite Justitiam moniti</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">“Et non temnere Divos.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Above, between the rails, are the old and new city arms, and
at the bottom are death’s-heads and bones. The whole of the interior
is composed of white marble; on the south and north are two
eows of fluted pilasters, one above another; on the west side are
statues representing four nude women, supporting the cornices
which crown the pilasters: two of these figures conceal their faces
with their hands, as indicative of shame: in the copartments between
are basso-relievos, representing the judgment of Solomon;
Zaleucus, the Locrian king, tearing out one of his eyes, to save
one of his son’s who had been condemned to lose both for adultery,
by a law made expressly against that crime by his father; and
Junius Brutus putting his sons to death. Above these are figures
representing Romulus and Remus drawing milk from the she wolf,
and also of Jupiter: the head of Medusa upon the shield of Pallas
is very finely executed. In the north, under a seat of white marble,
is a place for the secretary, who pronounces the fatal sentence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>when the magistrates appear in their robes at a gallery on the west
side. On the fore part of the judgement seat is a fine marble statue
of <cite>Silence</cite>, which Dutch gallantry represents under the form of
a <em>woman</em>, seated on the ground, with her finger on her mouth, and
two children weeping over a death’s-head. On each side of this seat
are serpents writhing round a tree, each with an apple in his mouth;
the same ornaments also decorate the sides of the door: above
the seat is a statue, raised on a black marble pedestal, representing
the city of Amsterdam as a virgin, guarded by a lion on each
side; above the head of the figure is an imperial crown, protected
by a spread eagle; on each side of the pedestal are Neptune and
Glaucus, representative of the rivers Y and Amstel, and a little
higher are the arms of the four burgomasters, in whose magistracy
the first stone of this building was laid, gracefully connected by
festoons. On the pedestal is an inscription in letters of gold, commemorative
of the laying of the first stone of the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal bas-reliefs and ornaments in this room, and other
parts of this edifice, were made by Artus Quellinus, a celebrated
statuary of Antwerp. When the awful doom of the law is to be
pronounced, the criminal is brought into this hall guarded, and
nothing is omitted in point of solemnity to impress on the mind
of the delinquent and the spectators the awful consequences of
violating the laws of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>A thorough knowledge of human nature dictated the policy of
placing this hall on the ground-floor, the brazen door of which
opens into a thoroughfare passage through the Stadt-house. I
never passed by this door without seeing numbers of the lower
orders of people gazing through the rails of it upon the emblematical
objects within, and apparently in melancholy meditation,
reflecting upon the purposes to which this hall is applied, and
upon the ignominious results of deviating from the paths of virtue.
On one side of this chamber is a a grand double staircase, which
leads to the Burghers’, or Marble Hall: it is 120 feet long, about
57 broad, and 80 high, and is entirely composed of white marble,
as are the galleries, which are 21 feet wide on each side, into
which the entrances to the different courts of justice, the chamber
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>of domains, of insurance, of orphans, the council-room, the offices
of the bank, &#38;c. open. This magnificent room and the surrounding
galleries were seen to great advantage, on account of their
having been cleaned previous to the coronation of the king, which
was intended to have taken place in it about a month after I visited
it. A great number of workmen had been employed in scraping,
washing, and polishing their marble sides for several months, and
their appearance was equally grand and beautiful: the bronze gates
and railing which form the grand entrance of the hall are massy,
yet exquisitely executed: over this entrance is a colonade of Corinthian
pillars of red and white marble. At one end is a colossal
figure of Atlas supporting on his shoulders the globe, attended by
Vigilance and Wisdom. The roof is painted with allegorical
figures. Upon the floor, the celestial and terrestrial globes are delineated
in brass and various coloured marbles, arranged in three
large circles twenty-two feet diameter; the two external ones representing
the hemispheres of the earth, and the centre the planisphere
of the heavens.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Burgomaster’s</em> Cabinet, as it is still called, is a handsome
apartment, the entrance of which is adorned with some beautiful
carving, emblematical of the use of the apartment. The chimney-piece
in this room, representing the triumphs of Fabius
Maximus, is worthy of notice. To the left of the Burgomasters’
chamber is a gallery, ten feet deep and thirty broad, where, after
the ringing of a bell to give notice, all proclamations, law sentences,
and municipal regulations, are promulgated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chamber of the treasury ordinary contains a picture of
Mary de Medicis as large as life; a chart of Amsterdam as it appeared
when first walled round in 1482; and on the bookcases are
some curious effigies of the ancient Earls and Countesses of Holland.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Burgomasters’ apartment is forty-five feet broad and thirty
deep, and is in my opinion the handsomest room in the Stadt-house.
The marble chimney-pieces are enriched with many exquisitely
sculptured basso-relievos by De Wit; but its chief ornament is
two paintings; one by Ferdinand Bol, representing Curius at his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>rural repast; and the other, Fabricius in the camp of Phyrrhus, by
Flink. From this room there is a passage to the Execution Chamber,
or <em>the Chamber of the last Prayers</em>, where criminals condemned
to death take leave of their priest, and pass through a window, the
lower part of which is of wood, to enable its being opened level
with the floor to the scaffold, which is constructed on the outside,
opposite to the weigh-house, and which is raised as high as this
part of the building. There is nothing in this room worthy of notice,
except its melancholy appropriation. From this room we were
conducted to the council chamber, which is forty-five feet wide and
thirty deep, where there is a very large painting by Jacob de Wilt,
representing Moses and the seventy elders of Israel. Above the
chimney-piece to the north is a very fine picture by Flink, the subject
Solomon imploring heaven for wisdom. Above this is a scriptural
subject, a noble production, from the pencil of Bronkhorst.
Some of the basso-relievos which adorn various parts of this room,
sculptured by De Wit, are exquisitely fine, particularly a hive of
bees, a clock, a sieve and a lamp, a pen and ink-horn. It would
puzzle a magician to interpret many of the allegorical devices, but
they are all beautifully executed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the chamber for marriages, and injuries, there is nothing
to arrest the attention of a visitor one minute. In Holland, marriage
being a civil contract, when agreed upon in Amsterdam, it
is always first performed before the magistrates in this room, without
whose fiat the ceremony would be invalid; the clergyman, according
to the religion of the parties, performs his functions afterwards.
This room is also called, amongst the lower orders of
people, the <em>Scolding Chamber</em>, on account of the irritability frequently
displayed here by parties of that class, when they come to
obtain redress for small offences. We were also led through the
chamber for sea affairs, the mercers’ hall, the painters’ chamber,
and in this room, but little suited to the treasures which it contains,
is a very long picture by Vandyke, in which there is a gray head
of an old man, of matchless excellence, which the observer cannot
but retire from with regret. The burgomasters of Amsterdam
were offered seven thousand florins for this head alone, to be cut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>out from the rest of the picture. There is also a large picture by
Vanderhelst, representing a feast given by the burgomasters of
Amsterdam to the ambassadors of Spain, on account of the peace
of Munster, which closed a war that had lain waste the Netherlands
for eighty years; and many other large and fine paintings by
Rubens, Jordaans, and Otho Venius. It is a matter of surprise,
that after Holland submitted to the French arms, these exquisite
productions should be permitted to remain, upon the walls which
they have so long adorned.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the great, or council of war chamber, there are some good
paintings representing the ancient train-bands, and officers in their
proper costume; many of which are portraits. In the secretary’s
office, a handsome room, amongst other decorations, is a basso-relievo
of <em>Silence</em>, which the Dutch are very fond of representing
under the form of a <em>woman</em>. Upon my observing to a Dutchman,
that in England such a compliment had never been paid to my own
lovely country women, he replied: “Yes, but do you not notice
that the statuary has placed the finger of the lady upon her mouth,
as if he thought that no one of the sex, not even a Dutch female,
could preserve silence without keeping her lips forcibly together
with her finger.” The convenience of having nearly all the principal
public offices, and courts of justice under one roof, is very
great; the size of the kingdom, and simplicity of its public transactions,
render such a concentration more easy of accomplishment
in Holland than in England.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before we ascended to the dome, we were introduced into the
great magazine of arms, which extends the whole length of the
front and part of the sides of this vast pile: it contains a curious and
valuable collection of ancient and modern Dutch arms. Some colours
which the French took from the Spaniards have been lately
added, as a present from the king to this city, a donation which
could not fail affording great gratification to a people, who to
this hour hold the Spanish nation in abhorrence. The prospect
from the tower, or dome, is very fine and extensive, commanding the
whole of the city and its environs, crowded with windmills, the river
Y filled with ships, the Zuyder Zee, the Amstel, the Haarlem lake,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>and the quarter containing the gardens, the admiralty, and ships
of war on the stocks. From this elevated spot we were nearer the
bronze figures which adorn the front, representing Justice, Wealth,
and Strength, and which are of an enormous size: on the other
side is a colossal bronze statue of Atlas supporting the world,
executed in a masterly manner. The tower contains a vast number
of bells, the largest of which weighs between six and seven thousand
pounds; the carillons in this dome are remarkably sweet,
they play every quarter of an hour an agreeable air, which is executed
to admiration. An excellent carilloneur is engaged to entertain
the citizens of Amsterdam three times a week; the perfection
to which he has brought his performance can only be appreciated
by those who have heard it. The brass barrel by which he plays
is seven feet and a half in diameter, and weighs four thousand four
hundred and seventy-four pounds. The clocks strike the full hour,
at the half hour, and upon the expiration of the full hour, repeat
it upon a bell of a deeper tone.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>By considerable interest, and with much difficulty, I was admitted
to see the prison which occupies one of the courts of the
Stadt-house, on two sides of which, below ground, are the dungeons,
to which the gaoler conducted us by a lamp: as a place of
confinement nothing can be more secure, and as a place of punishment
more horrible. After descending a dreary flight of steps,
and passing through a long narrow passage, midway vast double
doors, thickly plated with iron, were opened, through which we
entered, and at the end were stopped by two other massy doors
which, upon being unbolted, led to a row of subterranean dungeons.
In the first, by the faint light of a rush candle, I discerned
the emaciated figure of a man who had been convicted of robbery,
attentively reading: he just turned from his book to look at us a moment,
and then returned to it; he was condemned to inhabit this cell
alone for life! In the next were two young men who, in the forms of
Dutchmen, seemed to carry the elastic souls of Frenchmen, that
bend to and carol under every human misery; for in this gloomy
abode, in which one would suppose resignation would turn to
despair, they were whistling and waltzing in the dark; whilst in
the third were several women and a young girl, the latter about
fifteen, confined for having displayed an early, and rather too violent
a fondness for the laws of nature. These miserable beings were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>also in darkness, except when they closely approached the vast
double bars which crossed the windows of their cells, when they
were enabled to behold a little light, which faintly reached them
through some low oblong apertures on the opposite side of the
passage, thickly guarded by similar massy bars, just raised above
the level of the court, into which these poor wretches are never
permitted to walk; for, deplorable to relate, from the first minute
of their commitment till their fate is finally fixed, they are never
suffered to quit their gloomy abodes but to appear before their
judges in the adjoining hall, where they undergo private examinations,
and at length a close trial. The crimes with which these
latter unhappy prisoners stood charged were not of a very malignant
nature, yet were they, even before the guilt of some of them
was established, cut off from light and air, and immured in regions
fit only to be a receptacle for the dead. I need scarcely inform the
reader that their appearance when they pressed towards the grating,
when alone they were distinguishable, was in a high degree
squalid and sickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>None of these miserable wretches were loaded with irons; they
would, indeed, have been a very unnecessary augmentation of cruelty,
for nothing but the miraculous interference of an angel could
have burst their prison-doors, which were doubly cased with iron,
and fastened with enormous bolts and locks, whilst the walls of
the cells were cased with ponderous masonry, through which, if
a prisoner had the means to penetrate, he would afterwards have
to encounter all the earth upon which the rest of the Stadt-house
stood. The gaoler showed us some irons of a particular construction,
and a board which fastened round the neck and one hand, for
refractory criminals, but he assured me they had not been used
for many years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal secretary of the magistracy showed me the hall
of justice, which was also formerly the torture-chamber. Here the
miserable sufferer, who refused to confess his guilt, at the pleasure
of his barbarous judge, underwent a variety of torments; amongst
others, it was usual to fasten his hands behind his neck, with a
cord which passed through pullies fastened to a vaulted ceiling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>by means of which he was jerked up and down, with leaden weights
of fifty pounds each lashed to his feet, until anguish overpowered
his senses, and a confession of guilt was heard to quiver on his
lips. Some of the iron work by which this infamous process was
effected was still adhering to the walls. This ferocious and stupid
practice was only abolished in the year 1798. This room is entirely
of stone, low, and vaulted; the windows are small, and
guarded by vast double bars of iron, and the whole is very little
better than a large dungeon. A bar for the prisoner to appear at,
a seat for the witness, for only one is most judiciously admitted at
a time; a table and raised seats for the judges, and lower ones for
the officers attached to the tribunal, form all the arrangements of
this gloomy seat of justice. The prisoner is permitted to have a
counsellor to plead his cause, and no strangers are admitted on
any account. Three days are suffered to elapse between the sentence
and its execution in capital cases; during which the prisoner
is allowed whatever refreshment he may choose; an indulgence
which, from the state of the appetite at such a period, seldom runs
the state into much expense. Public punishments are inflicted four
times in the course of the year. On these occasions a vast scaffold
is erected, as I have mentioned, in the great area between the
stadt-house and the weighing or custom-house, upon a level with
the first floor of the former building, through which the criminals
enter to the spot assigned for them to receive their punishment:
those who are to be whipped receive that punishment with considerable
severity, and are not permitted to retire till those who are
to die have suffered death, which is inflicted by decapitation with
the sword or hanging, though the latter is most frequent. On these
melancholy occasions, the chief magistrates attend in their robes,
and nothing is omitted to augment the solemnity of the scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of its being expected that though a culprit
is to suffer death, he is to receive the fatal stroke in the precise
mode prescribed by the law, a magistrate who presided at the
execution of a murderer a few years since, had nearly subjected
himself to a severe punishment. The guilt of the criminal was
aggravated by cruelty, and he was condemned to lose his life by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>decapitation, in which case the law directs that it shall be severed
by one stroke of the sword: previous to his quitting the chamber
of the last prayers he laid a wager with a friend who attended him
that he had suggested an expedient by which the executioner
should not be able to perform his office; and accordingly, the
moment he knelt to receive the fatal stroke, he rolled his head in
every direction so violently, and so rapidly, that the executioner
could not strike him with any probability of decollating him at
one blow; and after many fruitless aims, was compelled to renounce
the attempt. The officers who were entrusted to see to the
execution of the sentence were in the greatest dilemma; in vain
did they try by argument to persuade the fellow to remain still, and
quietly have his head taken off; he was remanded back to prison, and
after an hour’s deliberation, the presiding magistrate, upon his own
responsibility, ordered the gallows to be brought out, upon which he
caused him to be executed. The judges and lawyers took alarm, and
half the city felt as if the murderer had been murdered; and nothing
but the high character, rank, and influence of the magistrate, by
whose resolute orders the miscreant at length paid the forfeit of his
life, preserved him from the most unpleasant consequences for enforcing
the spirit of the law after a different fashion from that prescribed.
Capital punishments are very rare: four malefactors were
executed in 1799, and nine since. The Dutch entertain a frightful
opinion of the criminal laws of England, which they consider very
sanguinary, from the great number of delinquents who are annually
put to death there.</p>

<p class='c007'>The strong apartments which formerly contained the vast
treasures of the bank, and the offices attached to that wealthy
concern, are on the ground-floor, where several clerks are employed
to transact the business of that celebrated establishment.
From the wise measures adopted by the king, who made, as I
have before observed, the recognition of the national debt one of
the first measures of his government, the national creditor has no
apprehensions. Before the war, this institution, which was a bank
of deposit, was supposed to contain the greatest quantity of bullion
in the world, and popular credulity dwelt with ostentatious fondness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>upon the extent of its accumulated treasures, which they resembled
to a Peruvian mine; its pile of precious metals was valued
at the enormous sum of forty millions. The regulations
which governed deposits made in this bank were as follow: the
person depositing cash or bullion received a credit in the books
for the amount, and a receipt for the same, which expired at the
end of six months, was given, renewable upon paying a small per
centage for warehouse rent: if such receipt expired before the
money or bullion was redeemed, neither the one nor the other
could be afterwards removed, but for it an equivalent in bank credit
was given, which receipt could afterwards be converted into
cash in the market. Another regulation was, that not a florin of
the cash or bullion invested should ever be removed by way of
loan. This compact between the bank and the creditor was always
considered inviolable. A rumour was circulated, with equal celerity
and anxiety, soon after the arrival of the French in Holland, highly
injurious to the responsibility of the institution, and a deputation
of merchants waited respectfully on the directors of the bank, to
solicit satisfaction as to its solvency; to which an answer, couched
in general terms, but favourable to its responsibility, was given.
Owing to the unshaken stability which it had displayed, from
1672, when Louis the Fourteenth, at the head of a victorious army,
was expected every hour to have made his triumphal entry into
Amsterdam, to 1795, when the French fixed the destiny of the
country, this answer was received with perfect confidence and security
in the bank, and any doubt upon the subject was considered
to be the result of party malignity. Upon the French taking possession
of Amsterdam, a complete investigation of the business
followed, and the official report of the provisional representatives
of the city announced, that</p>

<p class='c014'>“No deficiency whatever will exist in the said bank, and the debits
and credits will precisely balance, with this exception, that instead of
species, there have been received into the said bank, from time to time,
as securities for large sums advanced by it within the last fifty years, a
very considerable number of bonds, viz.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Seventy bonds of the India Company of Amsterdam, guaranteed
by the states of that province, being each of 100,000 florins banco, at three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>per cent. interest; besides a similar one of 50,000 banco, on which there will
be due, according to the calculation of the said clerks, the sums of 249,000
florins banco, for interest. On account of which bonds, the treasurer of the
said city is debited in the aforesaid balance 6,273,000 florins banco.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Besides these, there are fifty bonds, each for 24,000 florins, on account
of the provinces of Holland and West Friesland, belonging to the
loan-office of this city, on which, according to the information of the clerks,
the bank has advanced, agreeable to the aforesaid balance, the sum of
838,857 florins banco, on which there will be due for interest 30,000 florins.
In addition to which, the loan-office owes the bank, conformable to the
same information, the sum of 1,715,000 florins banco.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That there is also due, from the said bank, 227,264 2 8, for which
bonds were originally given; but according to the clerk’s statement were
burnt; but for which the city notwithstanding paid interest annually to the
bank.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That it is nevertheless obvious, that the city is responsible for this
sum, as well as for the whole, as it ought to be considered with respect
to it, not only as guarantee, but as actual debtor to the bank.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That moreover, among other things in the said bank, there has been
found in substance all the specie for which accountable receipts have
been given, agreeable to the list made out, and delivered to the committee
of commerce and marine by the cashiers of the bank, and which can,
in consequence, be at all times drawn out by the holders of the said receipts,
in exchange for them, when it shall please them so to do.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The aforesaid provisional representatives have, therefore, not only
taken the requisite, and most efficacious measures, that henceforward
there shall not be delivered from, nor advanced by, the said bank, contrary
to its original institution, any specie whatsoever, by any authority,
either as a loan, or in any other illegal manner; but also that the said
bonds, lodged in the said bank as securities, as aforesaid, shall be liquidated
as soon as possible, and generally, that this city, as debtor to the bank,
shall, with all practicable dispatch, discharge in cash the balance of its
account with the said bank, which being done, the provisional representatives
declare, that there can exist no deficiency of any kind soever; and
that they will, without delay, take into their serious consideration, and
will carry into immediate effect, the means to obtain this end.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For this sum, amounting to upwards of nine millions of florins,
the proper investments had been made, but of the deposits, which
ought to have been permanent, in consequence of the expiration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>of the receipts, not a florin remained in the caves of the bank.
It appeared that the directors, like the magistrate who presided at
the execution of the murderer, beneficially for the state, no doubt
had departed from the strict letter of the law, and instead of suffering
so much wealth to remain in a state of unproductive inertion,
they had duplicated the energies of credit by judicious and
advantageous loans of it to a variety of merchants and tradesmen.
This statement excited the highest indignation against the directors,
who were, in the violence of that party-spirit which then
raged in Holland, branded with every epithet which appertains to
the real national defaulter. The deficiency thus explained could
have no injurious influence upon the bank, with regard to the cash
receipts which were unexpired, unless the debts due to the bank,
upon such accommodations, should not be regularly discharged.
But no explanation could appease the popular fury, which connected
this politic deviation from the strict letter of an unwise law
into high treason against the state, and loudly demanded, that all
the directors of the bank, and persons entrusted with the management
of any other public fund, should be put under arrest: to such
a height was this spirit carried, that many of the members of the
old government would have been sacrificed to the animosity of
faction, and revolutionary vengeance, had not the French general
interfered, and by a humane proclamation addressed to people enlightened
by the benign effects of public education, averted their
anger.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 16th of February, 1795, upon the promulgation of the
abolition of the stadtholderate, a general fraternization took place
in Amsterdam, and a complete oblivion of all public animosities.
This federation was celebrated, as I was informed, with all imaginable
pomp. The carillons in the towers of the Stadt-house, and
the principal churches, played the most enchanting patriotic airs,
the tri-coloured flag waived upon their spires, and salutes from the
bastions, artillery, and men of war, augmented the vivacity of this
eventful day. Nothing could surpass the grotesque drollery exhibited
in various parts of the city: the gaiety of the French character
completely electrified the sobriety of the Batavian. Grave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Dutch brokers, whose blood had long ceased to riot, who thought
that the great purposes of life were answered when the duties of
the bureau were discharged; who, could they have compared,
would have preferred the brick of the exchange, to the “verd’rous
wall of Paradise,” who had never moved but with a measured funeral
pace, were seen in large full-bottomed wigs, and with great
silver buckles, mingling in the national dance, with the gay ethereal
young Parisian conscripts, so that it might be said of the
Dutchman,</p>

<p class='c007'>To such an elevation did the national spirit and ardour rise,
that upon a requisition requiring every person to deliver up all
the uncoined gold and silver, or plate (spoons and forks excepted)
for the use of the state, there appeared to be no reluctance to obey
it, and as these state offerings exceeded the estimate required, it is
likely that none were concealed. When these contributions exceeded
in value the amount of the taxes, to which the contributor was
liable, a receipt was given for such excess, and carried to his credit,
in the next payments; with these assistances, the government immediately
directed its attention to the deplorable state of its marine,
which under the last of the Stadtholders, had experienced the most
ruinous and fatal neglect, in consequence of the influence of the
British cabinet upon the imbecile mind of that unfortunate prince.
When it is considered upon the breaking out of the last war with
Holland, how numerous and valuable were the Dutch ships detained
in British ports, what havoc our cruisers made on her commerce,
by intercepting her rich merchant vessels, and blockading her ports,
what a stagnation of internal trade must have followed, and what
enormous sums were extorted by the French army and its generals,
the reader may form some opinion of the prodigious opulence
of this country, which, under the pressure of such calamities, is
still enabled to raise her head with such few marks of suffering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Amsterdam has no noble squares, which add so much to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>splendor of London, nor is there any bridge worthy of being noticed,
except that which crosses the river Amstel, which is built
of brick, has thirteen arches, and is tolerably handsome: on the
river looking towards this bridge, there is a fine view of the city,
which I preferred sketching, to a more expanded one on the coast
immediately opposite to the city, in the north of Holland. The
only association throughout Holland, which resembles a monastic
one, is that of the Beguines, who reside in a large house appropriated
to their order, which is surrounded with a wall and ditch,
has a church within, and resembles a little town; this sisterhood
is perfectly secular, the members of which wear no particular
dress, mingle with the inhabitants of the city, quit the convent,
and marry when they please: but they are obliged, as long as they
belong to the order, to attend prayers at stated periods, and to be
within the convent at a certain hour every evening. To be admitted
of this order, they must be either unmarried or widows without
children, and the only certificate required is that of good behaviour,
and that they have a competence to live upon. The restraints are
so very few, that a Beguine may rank next to a happy wife: they
have each an apartment and a little flower-garden, and take no
vows of celibacy or of any other sort; in short, the whole establishment
may be considered as a social retirement of amiable women,
for the purpose of enjoying life in an agreeable and blameless
manner. How superior this to living</p>

<p class='c007'>The ladies of Holland, if I may judge from those with whom
I had the honour and happiness of associating in Amsterdam, are
very amiable, thoroughly well bred, well educated, speak English,
French and German, and they are very polite and courteous to
strangers: they are also remarkable for their attention to decorum
and modesty; the unmarried, without prudery, are highly virtuous,
and the married present a pattern of conjugal fidelity. They
are also very fond of dancing, particularly of waltzing, and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>are much attached to English country dances, in which the most
graceful Parisian belle seldom appears to any advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The interior of the houses belonging to the higher classes in
Amsterdam is very elegant; the decoration and furniture of their
rooms is very much in the French style: they are also very fond
of having a series of landscapes, painted in oil colours, upon the
sides of the rooms, instead of stucco or paper, or of ornamenting
them with pictures and engravings. The average rent of respectable
houses, independent of taxes, is from one thousand to twelve
hundred florins. The dinner hour, on account of the exchange, is
about four o’clock in this city, and their modes of cooking unite
those of England and France: immediately after dinner the whole
company adjourn to coffee in the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>The water in this part of Holland is so brackish and feculent
that it is not drank even by the common people. There are water-merchants,
who are constantly occupied in supplying the city with
drinkable water, which they bring in boats from Utrecht and
Germany, in large stone bottles: the price of one of these bottles,
containing a gallon, is about eight pence English. The poor, who
cannot afford to buy it, substitute rain-water. The wines drank are
principally claret and from the Rhine. The vintage of Portugal
has no more admirers here than at Rotterdam, except amongst
young Dutchmen, who have either been much in England, or are
fond of the taste and fashions of our country.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The laws in Holland against nocturnal disturbers of the peace
are very severe. A few months before I was in Amsterdam, two
young gentlemen of family and fortune had been condemned to
pay ten thousand florins for having, when “flushed with the Tuscan
grape,” rather rudely treated two women of the lower orders.
The night police of Holland would form an excellent model for
that of England. The watchmen are young, strong, resolute and
well appointed, but annoying to a stranger; for they strike the
quarter-hour with a mallet on a board; which disturbs his repose,
unless he is fortunate enough to sleep in a back room, or until he
becomes accustomed to the clatter. Midnight robberies and fires
very seldom occur: to guard against the spreading of the latter,
there are persons appointed, whose office it is to remain all day
and all night in the towers or steeples of the highest churches,
and as soon as they discern the flame, to suspend, if it be in the
day, a flag; if in the night, a lantern towards the quarter of the
city in which it rises, accompanied by the blowing of a trumpet.
This vigilance, and the facility of procuring water in summer, the
natural caution of the people, and their dread of such an accident,
conspires to render it a very rare visitor. An average calculation of
fires which occur in London, where a regular account of all such accidents
are registered, by each fire insurance company having an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>establishment of firemen and engines, may be collected from the register
of one year, commencing from Michaelmas 1805, viz. three
hundred and six alarms of fire attended with little damage, thirty-one
serious fires, and one hundred and fifty-five alarms, occasioned
by chimneys being on fire, amounting in all to four hundred and
ninety-two accidents. The English fire insurance companies calculate
on an alarm of fire every day, and about eight serious fires
in every quarter of a year. This is a frightful estimate, and when
it is considered, that scarcely a fire of any material extent has been
known in the memory of man to have broken out in either of the
universities, or in any of the inns of court, where it would be most
likely they would occur, on account of the frequent carelessness
of the inhabitants, little doubt can remain on the minds of any one,
that infinitely the greater number of fires which happen are the
fatal consequences of diabolical design.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although, owing to the great frugality and industry of the
people, an insolvent debtor is rather a rare character, consequently
held in more odium in Holland than in most other countries, yet
the laws of arrest are milder there than in England. If the debtor
be a citizen or registered burgher, he is not subject to have his
person seized at the suit of the creditor, until three regular summonses
have been duly served upon him, to appear in the proper
court, and resist the claim preferred against him, which process is
completed in about a month; after which, if he does not obey it,
his person is subject to arrest, but only when he has quitted his
house; for in Holland a man’s dwelling is held even more sacred
than in England, and no civil process whatever is capable of being
served upon him, if he stands but on the threshold of his home.
In this sanctuary he may set at defiance every claimant; if, however,
he has the hardihood to appear abroad, without having satisfied
or compromised his debt, he is then pretty sure, from the
vigilance and activity of the proper officers, to be seized; in which
case he is sent to a house of restriction, not a prison for felons,
where he is maintained with liberal humanity, the expenses of
which, as well as of all the proceedings, must be defrayed by the
creditor. Under these qualifications, every debtor is liable to arrest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>let the amount of the debt be ever so small. The bankrupt
laws of Holland differ from ours in this respect, that all the creditors
must sign the debtor’s certificate, or agreement of liberation;
but if any refuse, the ground of their refusal is submitted to arbitrators,
who decide whether the bankrupt shall, notwithstanding,
have his certificate or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>A passenger can seldom pass a street without seeing one or
more public functionaries, I believe peculiar to this country; they
are called aanspreeker, and their office is to inform the friends and
acquaintances of any one who dies, of the melancholy event. The
dress of these death-messengers is a black gown, a band, a low
cocked hat with a long crape depending behind. To pass from the
shade of death to the light of love: a singular custom obtains upon
the celebration of marriage amongst genteel persons, for the bride
and bridegroom to send each a bottle of wine, generally fine
hock, spiced and sugared, and decorated with all sorts of ribbands,
to the house of every acquaintance; a custom which is frequently
very expensive. The Dutch have also a singular mode of airing
linen and beds, by means of a trokenkorb, or fire-basket, which is
about the size and shape of a magpie’s cage, within which is a pan
filled with burning turf, and the linen is spread over its wicker
frame, or to air the bed, the whole machine is placed between the
sheets. With an exception of the streets I have mentioned, and
some others in that quarter of the city, they are not remarkable
either for beauty or cleanliness. They are all paved with brick, and
none of them have any divided flagstone footpath for foot-passengers:
however, the pavement is more handsome and comfortable
than that of Paris; although in both cities the pedestrian has no
walk that he can call his own, yet in Amsterdam is he more secure
than in the French capital, on account of the few carriages, and the
skill and caution of the drivers. In no capital in the world, not
even excepting Petersburg, is the foot-passenger so nobly accommodated
as in London. Most of the streets in Amsterdam are narrow;
and many in which very opulent merchants reside, and great
traffic is carried on, are not more than sixteen or seventeen feet
wide.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>The canals of this city are very convenient, but many of them
most offensively impure, the uniform greenness of which is chequered
only by dead cats, dogs, offal, and vegetable substances of
every kind, which are left to putrefy at the top, until the canal
scavengers, who are employed to clean the canals, remove them:
the barges which are used on these occasions, and the persons
employed in them, present a very disgusting appearance; the mud
which is raised by them, forms most excellent manure, and the
sum it fetches in Brabant, is calculated to be equal to the expenses
of the voyage. Some of the most eminent Dutch physicians
maintain that the effluvia arising from the floating animal and
vegetable matter of these canals, is not injurious, and in proof,
during a contagious fever which ravaged this city, it was observed,
that the inhabitants who resided nearest to the foulest canals, were
not infected, whilst those who lived near purer water, only in few
instances escaped; but this by no means confirms the assertion,
because those inhabitants who lived adjoining to foul canals, were
inured to contagion from its habitual application, for the same
reason that medical men and nurses generally escape infection,
from being so constantly exposed to it. The fair criterion would be
to ascertain whether, when the city is healthy, such quarters of it
continue more so. The effluvia arising from putrid animal matter,
by the medical people of this country, and of almost every other,
is considered far from being innoxious, but infinitely less injurious
than that evolved by the decomposition of vegetables: at the same
time there are many offensive smells that are far from being unwholesome,
for instance, that of the bilge-water of a ship, and others
might be enumerated. The water of these canals is in general
about eight or nine feet deep, and the mud at the bottom about
six more. Except in very foggy nights, few deaths by drowning,
considering the amount of the population, occur in these canals,
and fewer would still happen, if they were guarded against by a
railing, which is rarely erected in any part of the city. At night,
as the city is well lighted, a passenger, unless he is blind, or very
much inebriated, a disgraceful condition, which as I have before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>observed is not often displayed in Holland, is not very likely to
experience a watery death.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, to guard as much as possible against the gloomy
consequence of these casualties, the keepers of all inns and taverns,
and all apothecaries in Amsterdam, and in every other city in
Holland, are compelled under a heavy penalty to keep a printed
paper containing the most approved method of resuscitating the
suspended animation of drowned persons, in a conspicuous part of
their houses. The government is also very liberal in distributing
rewards to those who, at their personal peril, rescue a fellow-creature
from destruction. Upon such occasions, gold, silver, or medals
are bestowed, according to the risk and rank of the preserver.
The first society for the restoring of drowned persons was formed
in this city in 1767, and the utmost encouragement was every
where given throughout the united provinces, by the magistrates
in particular, and afterwards by the states-general, and the success
of it has been equal to its humanity. To the Dutch nation the
English are indebted for these admirable institutions, by which so
many of our countrymen have at various times been snatched
from the gripe of death, and restored as it were to a new existence,
and to their agonized families. It is a curious circumstance to remark,
that the visible disarrangement which the human frame
experiences, from being a considerable time in water, is very little,
so little that many are the instances where the sufferer has, in
the first instance, displayed all the indicia of death, and has within
a few hours been enabled to thank his deliverer in person. The
body, during this temporary suspension of animation, resembles a
clock, upon its pendulum being accidently stopped, its works are
not mutilated nor shaken out of their proper places, but are competent
to renew their functions the moment the former is touched
by some friendly hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a memorable illustration, I beg to relate an anecdote of an
illustrious hero and august personage, who shedding light and
happiness upon nearly forty millions of beings, and ruling once
the most extensive empire upon the face of the earth, felt that he
added a new ray of glory and happiness to his imperial dignity in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>preserving, by his own perseverance, a miserable fellow-creature
from a watery grave.</p>

<p class='c007'>In one of the journeys which his Imperial Majesty the Emperor
Alexander made through Poland, as he was riding alone, his
attendants being considerably behind him, on the banks of the
little river Wilia, which flows between Kouna and Wilna in
Lithuania, he perceived some persons assembled near the edge of
the water, out of which they appeared to be dragging something;
he instantly alighted, and on approaching the spot, found it to be
the body of a man apparently lifeless. Urged by those exalted sensibilities
which regard rank and power only as bounties delegated
by heaven for the benefit of mankind, the monarch, without any
other assistance than that of the ignorant boors about him, who
from his uniform could only conceive him to be an officer of rank,
drew the apparent corpse completely from the water, and laid it
on the side of a bank, and with his own hands took off the wet
clothes of the poor sufferer, and began to rub his temples and
breast, which he continued to do for a considerable time with the
most ardent anxiety, but found all his efforts to restore animation
ineffectual: in the midst of this humane occupation, the Emperor
was joined by the gentlemen of his suite, amongst whom were
Prince Wolkousky, and Count Liewen, two Russian noblemen,
and Dr. Weilly, his majesty’s principal surgeon, an English gentleman
of distinguished professional talents, who always travels
with, and is scarcely ever from his majesty. They united their exertions
to those of the Emperor, and when Dr. Weilly attempted,
but in vain, to bleed the poor creature, his majesty supported and
chafed his arms, and lent every other assistance in his power: for
<em>three hours</em> were they thus employed with all the ardour of humanity,
but saw no symptoms of returning life, and Dr. Weilly
pronounced the patient irrecoverable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fatigued as the Emperor was with these unceasing exertions,
he would not relinquish the work as a hopeless one, but by his
own example and language, urged and encouraged Dr. Weilly to
renew his labours, which, solely in obedience to his Imperial Majesty’s
wishes, and completely despairing of success, he recommenced;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>and as the whole party were making the last effort, the
emperor had the inexpressible satisfaction of seeing the blood flow
from the puncture, and of hearing a faint groan issue from the
lips of his patient.</p>

<p class='c007'>The emotions of his Imperial Majesty at this moment were
indescribable, and in the fulness of his transport he exclaimed
in French, “<em>Great God! this is the brightest day of my life!</em>” and
tears of joy sparkled in his eyes, to ratify the feelings of his heart.
Every exertion was now redoubled, and as humanity loves to dwell
upon the minutest circumstances of this affecting scene, I must
not omit to relate, that when Dr. Weilly looked round for something
to stop the blood with, the Emperor with vivid promptitude
took out his handkerchief, tore it in pieces, with his own hands
bound the sufferer’s arm, and remained with him until he completely
recovered, when he conveyed him to a place where proper
care could be administered to him; at parting, he ordered him a
liberal present of money, and afterwards, upon his return to his
capital, as if grateful to him for so large a portion of felicity,
settled a pension upon him and his family. The sensations of the
patient, when he was informed of the exalted rank of his preserver,
can be better felt than described. The poor inhabitants of that part
of Poland, who were but rude artists, fabricated four snuff-boxes,
on the lids of which they delineated, as well as they were able, this
striking and exemplary event, which they presented to the Emperor
and the gentlemen who assisted him in this work of humanity.
Such is the heart of a prince, who, almost unassailable in his mighty
empire, and moved alone by the elevated desire of impeding
the gigantic progress of a power which aims at universal domination,
renounced all the pleasure of tranquillity, and at the head of
his gallant legions thundered at the gates of princes, to awaken
them from their fatal lethargy, and to invoke them to oppose the
common enemy of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alas! the solemn invocation was faintly and imperfectly obeyed.
In vain did the heroic Alexander endeavour to impart to other
chiefs, whose humiliation, if not destruction, must be the fruits of
their supineness, that divine energy which actuated his own bosom.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>The historian, whilst with rapture he dwells upon the valor and
the disinterested energy of Alexander, with burning blushes will
relate the mournful results which followed the dire neglect of his
solemn and unexampled appeal. To his renewed struggles in this
mighty and august cause, the eyes of England, with whom his
name will ever be consecrated, and of prostrate nations panting,
without the spirit to contend for their deliverance, are turned with
ardent anxiety. May glory crown the arms of such a prince, and
may his days be long in the land!</p>

<p class='c007'>The exchange here is in the same style of architecture as
that of Rotterdam, but larger. My astonishment here was even
greater than what I experienced at the latter place; for, at the
exchange hour, it was overflowing with merchants, brokers, agents,
and all the busy motley characters who belong to commerce.
From the prevailing activity, the appetite for accumulation here
appeared to have experienced no checks from the inevitable  calamities
of war. My surprise was augmented by reflecting, with
these appearances before me, upon the present and former commercial
condition of the country. The principal causes which contributed
to render Amsterdam so rich before the two last wars,
were the invincible industry, the caution, and frugality of the people.
The ancient merchants of Amsterdam preferred small gains
with little risk, to less probable, and to larger profits: it was their
creed, that more fortunes were raised by saving and economy,
with moderate advantages, than by bold, expensive, and perilous
speculations. This golden rule they transmitted to their posterity,
who have exhibited no great disposition to deviate from it. A
Dutch merchant of the present day almost always calculates the
chances for and against his success in any undertaking, which he
will immediately relinquish unless they are very greatly in his
favour, and as nearly reducible to certainty as possible: he very
rarely over-trades himself, or extends his schemes beyond his
capital: such was the foundation upon which the commerce of
Amsterdam was raised.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal sources of commercial wealth to Holland arose
from her herring and Greenland fisheries, which employed a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>portion of her population. The superior manner in which the
Dutch pickle and preserve their herrings is peculiar to themselves,
nor has it been in the power of England, or any other country, to
find out the secret which lies, it is said, in the manner of gilling
and salting those fish. The persons who are acquainted with the
art, are bound by an oath never to impart it, hitherto religiously
adhered to, and the disclosure of it is moreover guarded against
by the laws of the country. This national source of wealth has
been greatly impeded, in consequence of the Dutch having no
herring fisheries of their own, but being obliged to seek them on
the English coast at the proper season, where, particularly off Yarmouth,
the herring shoals have been known to be six and seven
feet deep with fish. The permission granted to the Dutch fishermen,
to prosecute their occupation unmolested on our coasts, notwithstanding
the war, was frequently withdrawn by our cruisers.
Last year a private agreement took place between the two countries,
and the indulgence was renewed, by which the Dutch were
very abundantly supplied with their favourite fish: so much esteemed
is it, that the first herring cured was always presented to
the stadtholder, and opulent families have been known to give
seven shillings, and even a guinea, for the first herrings brought
to market.</p>

<p class='c008'>For more than a century the Dutch East India Company
enjoyed the monopoly of the fine spices, comprehending nutmegs,
cloves, mace, cinnamon, &#38;c. which constituted the principal branch
of the Asiatic as well as the European commerce of Holland:
360,000<em>lbs.</em> cloves were annually sent to Europe, and about
150,000<em>lbs.</em> were sold in India; 250,000<em>lbs.</em> of nutmeg, the produce of
the island of Banda, used to be sold in Europe, and 100,000<em>lbs.</em> in
India. In Europe also 400,000<em>lbs.</em> of cinnamon used to be brought
to market, and 200,000<em>lbs.</em> consumed in India. Batavia presents
a wonderful instance of the enterprise of the Dutch, who, born
themselves in a marshy country, below the level of the ocean,
erected a kingdom in the fifth degree of north latitude, in the
most prolific part of the globe, where the fields are covered
with rice, pepper, and cinnamon, and the vines bear fruit twice
a year. Although this colony remains to Holland, the Dutch
spice market must have very materially suffered, from the vigilance
of our ships of war in various parts of the world, and particularly
from the recent capture of her valuable spice ships returning
home richly laden from that colony. The Dutch also carried on a
large trade in rice, cotton, and pepper, and the Java coffee, which
was thought to be second only to that of Mocha. The reader may,
perhaps, be surprised to find that the amount of the spice exports
should every year be the same. The Dutch East India Company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>was enabled to make this calculation in consequence of having acquired
a tolerably exact knowledge of the quantity of each kind of
spice that would be necessary for the consumption of the European
markets, and never permitting any more to be exported. In this
branch of trade they had no competition, and they were enabled to
keep the price of their spices as high as they chose, by ordering
what remained unsold at the price they had fixed upon it, to be
burnt. Their spices gave them an influence upon the trade of the
north of Europe, in consequence of their being highly prized by
the different nations on the shores of the Baltic, who furnished the
Dutch with their grain, hemp, flax, iron, pitch, tar, masts, planks,
&#38;c. The surrender of Curraçoa to the British arms must also be
severely felt. This island was always of great importance to the
Dutch, the possession and commerce of which they were very desirous
of retaining and extending. The Dutch West India Company,
many years since, refused to exchange it for the Spanish
island of Porto Rico. The commerce of Curraçoa formerly took
up yearly about fifty large ships, upon an average of 300 tons each,
and the quantity of goods annually shipped from Holland amounted
to 500,000<em>l.</em> and the returns nearly doubled that sum. The exports
from Holland consisted of German and Dutch linens, checks,
East India goods, woollen and cotton manufactures, spices, cinnamon,
building materials, and many other articles of ease and
luxury. The imports to Europe were indigo, coffee, sugar, hides,
cotton, dye-wood, tortoiseshell, varinas, Porto Rico tobacco, and
occasionally cochineal. The Dutch also carried on a very flourishing
trade to Turkey and the Levant, by selling their own, the Irish
and English cloths, and purchasing tea, cocoa, ginger, and thread.
The commercial intercourse also between Holland and England
was very important, in which the balance in specie was greatly
against the Dutch, which induced many, who were ignorant of
their real character, to conclude, that they never could support so
prodigious a drain of specie as they have invariably experienced
in such communications; an impression which subsides when it is
considered that the Dutch consumed but little of what they imported
from England, and that what they purchased they resold in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>an improved condition to other countries. A nation can only become
rich from trade when its exports for the use of foreign states
is in a greater proportion than its imports for its own consumption.
An impression has gone forth, that a nation cannot be impoverished
if the importation of foreign merchandize be purchased abroad by
native commodity and not with specie; whereas upon a nation
striking the balance of her account with the country she may have
dealt with, it will be found that the deficiency on the side of her
exportation must be made up in specie. Hence an industrious and
frugal people like the Dutch will, when their country is in a state
of tranquillity, possess great advantages over most other nations.
Industry increases the native commodity, whether it arises from
the soil or the manufacture, and increases the exportation. Frugality
will lessen the consumption, and of course increase the exportation
of native, and reduce the importation of foreign produce, for
home consumption. The excess of all native commodities is sure
of a market, of which those who can sell the cheapest will be the
masters: hence a frugal and industrious people will be able to live
and accumulate, where those who are neither could not live. This
spirit of industry and frugality has been for ages, and still continues
to be the guardian of this nation, by which it was enabled
to support its many, long, and costly wars, and finally to force the
king of Spain, its ancient master, to recognise its independent
sovereignty. Although the Hollanders, before the last war, were
the undisputed proprietors of the Indian spices, of the silks of
India and China, and of the fine cotton manufactures of Indostan,
till a period at no great distance the common people wore plain
woollen cloth, and fed on fish and vegetables. So universally powerful
was this propensity to economy, that formerly the common
people, and even opulent merchants, never changed their fashions,
and left off their clothes only because they were worn out. They
have been known to purchase the coarse English cloth for their
own wear, and sell their own fine Leyden cloths to Germany,
Turkey, Portugal, and other countries: they also bought the
cheapest butter and cheese in the north of England, and in Ireland,
for their own consumption, and sent the best of those articles produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>in their own country to foreign markets. The wealth which
many individuals accumulated by their parsimonious habits was
astonishing. The following anecdote will place this part of the national
character in a striking point of view. As the marquis of
Spinola and the president Richardot were going to the Hague in
the year 1608, for the purpose of negotiating a truce with the
Dutch, they saw on their way eight or nine persons step out of a
little boat, and seat themselves upon the grass, where they made a
frugal repast upon some bread, cheese, and beer; each person taking
his own provisions from a wallet which he carried behind him.
Upon the Spanish ambassadors inquiring of a peasant who these
travellers were, he replied, to their no little astonishment, “they are
the deputies of the states, our sovereign lords and masters.” Upon
which the ambassadors exclaimed, “We shall never be able to conquer
these people; we must make peace with them.” In the history
of Sparta we can only look for a similar instance of virtuous simplicity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another source from which Amsterdam derived great wealth
was the exchange and banking business. From her peculiar situation,
vast credit; and extensive correspondence with every nation
upon the face of the globe, this city has been the channel through
which nearly three parts of the money remitted from one state to
another in Europe have passed, and which have enriched the merchants
by the customary commissions upon such remittances: to
which may be added the duties payable upon all imports received
from the manufactures of the western part of Germany, upon all
goods which in their transit by the Rhine and by the Maas to foreign
markets must pass through Amsterdam or Rotterdam, from
which Holland must have derived a considerable revenue. In short,
in other and better times, the trade with Great Britain, Persia,
Russia, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Cochin and its dependencies, Molucca,
China, Japan, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Pomerania, Livonia,
the possession of that important promontory the Cape of
Good Hope, and the commerce of the Elbe, the Weser, and the
Maas, all contributed to raise Amsterdam to the commercial renown
which she once enjoyed. Yet, notwithstanding, under all her
difficulties, arising from her territorial and marine losses by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>war, the severity of the English blockade, the activity of the English
cruisers, and of the French privateers, Holland still continues
to carry on a considerable intercourse with her old connexions
through the medium of neutral bottoms, secured by insurances
effected frequently at the enormous premium of 20<em>l.</em> per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>To return to the Exchange of this great city: I was much
struck with the confluence of people which surrounded one gentleman,
who stood with his back towards one of the pillars, and
were very eager to get a word or a whisper from him: upon inquiry
this proved to be the acting partner of the house of Messrs. Hope;
a house that, before the last war, could at any time dictate the exchange
to Europe. This place is infested by a great number of
Jew fruiterers, who practise all sorts of stratagems to set off
their fruit, such as pinning the stalk of a fresh melon upon the
bottom of a stale and rotten one, which had nearly succeeded with
me. The melons in Holland are remarkably fine; and as a proof
of their cheapness, I need only mention, that one morning, when
strolling through the streets, I gave no more than the value of ten
pence for a very large one, exquisitely flavoured.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was much pleased with seeing the marine school, which,
although its object is to form a nursery for naval officers, was,
strange to relate, much neglected by the stadtholderian government,
and was originally instituted, and afterwards supported, by
the patriotic spirit of private individuals. The pupils are the children
of citizens of all classes, and are received from seven to twelve
years of age, upon the payment of a very moderate yearly stipend.
Their education and treatment are the same as in similar institutions
here and in other countries. In the yard is a brig completely
rigged, for the instruction of the boys.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the north-east part of the city stands the Rapshuys, or rasp-house,
in which criminals, whose offences are not of a capital nature,
are confined. A narrow court receding from the street, in which
are the keeper’s lodge and apartments for the different officers,
form the entrance of this prison. Over the gate are some insignificant,
painted, wooden figures, representing criminals sawing logwood,
and Justice holding a rod over them. The gaoler, apparently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>a good natured, merry fellow, showed me into the inner court,
forming an oblong square, on three sides of which the cells of the
prisoners, and on the fourth side the warehouses, containing the
ground dying wood, are arranged. This yard is very much encumbered
with piles of logwood, which sadly reduce the miserable
pittance of space allotted for the prisoners to walk in. In one
corner, in terrorem, is a whipping-post, with another little figure
of Justice holding a rod. In this yard I saw some of the men sawing
the Campeachy-wood, with a saw of prodigious large teeth,
which appeared to be a work of extreme labour; and upon my so
expressing myself to the gaoler, through my <i><span lang="fr">laquais de place</span></i>, he
informed me, that at first it required a painful exertion of strength,
but that the prisoners by practice were enabled to saw it with ease,
and to supply their weekly quota of two hundred pounds weight of
sawed pieces, and also to make a variety of little articles in straw,
bone, wood, and copper, to sell to those who visited the prison.
The prison dress consists of a jacket, or surtout of white wollen,
white shirts, hats, flannel stockings, and leather shoes. The conduct
of these unfortunate persons is annually reported to the magistrate,
who regulates the period of their confinement, where the
case will admit of an exercise of discretion, by such report.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a corner of the yard I was shown a cell, in which, if the person
who is confined in it does not incessantly pump out the water
let into it, he must inevitably be drowned; but the gaoler informed
me, that it had not been used for many years, and that it was now
only an object of terror. In the warehouses, which are very shabby,
were piles of rasped wood for dyeing various colours; amongst
others, the Evonymus Europæus, the Morus Tinctoria, and the
Hæmotoxylum Campechionum. I was informed, that women who
are attached to the prisoners, are permitted to visit them at stated
periods, without any restraint, by which one of the great political
objects of Holland, the encouragement of population, does not
suffer by this wholesome separation of the faulty from the blameless
members of society. The number of prisoners amounted to
124; they were far from looking healthy; this I attributed more to
the height of the walls enclosing the yard, which, as well as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>number of logwood piles, must greatly impede the circulation of
the air, than to excess of toil and severity of treatment. The prisoners
are not encumbered with irons, and I should think an escape
from such a prison might be easily effected.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the rasp-house I proceeded to the work-house, in the
east quarter of the city, close to the Muider and Prince Gragts, an
establishment which I believe has no parallel in the world. It is a
vast building: the purposes to which it is applied are partly correctional
and partly charitable. The number of persons within its
walls, when I saw it, amounted to seven hundred and fifty of both
sexes, and the annual expense is about one hundred thousand florins.
In the rooms belonging to the governors and directresses, are
some exquisite pictures by Vandyke, Rembrandt, and Jordaens. In
a vast room very cleanly kept and well ventilated, were an immense
number of women, occupied in sewing, spinning, &#38;c.; amongst
them was a fine, handsome, hearty looking Irish woman, who
had been confined two years at the instance of her husband, for
being more fond of a little true Schidam gin than of her liege
spouse. In another vast apartment, secured by massy iron railing
and grated windows, were about seventy female convicts, who appeared
to be in the highest state of discipline, and were very industriously
and silently engaged in making lace, &#38;c. under the superintendency
of a governess. From the walls of the room were suspended
instruments of punishment, such as scourges, irons for the
legs, &#38;c. which, we were informed, were not spared upon the
slightest appearance of insubordination. These women are always
kept apart from the rest. The wards of the men, and the school-rooms
for a great number of children, who are educated and maintained
under the same roof, as well as the dormitories, were in the highest
state of neatness. In another part of this building, never shown
to strangers, were confined about ten young ladies, of very respectable,
and some of very high families, sent there by their parents
or friends for undutiful deportment, or some other domestic offence.
They are compelled to wear a particular dress as a mark of degradation,
obliged to work a stated number of hours a day, and are
occasionally whipped: they are kept apart by themselves, and no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>one but a father, mother, brother, or sister, can see them during
their confinement, and then only by an order from one of the directors.
Husbands may here, upon complaint of extravagance,
drunkenness, &#38;c. duly proved, send their wives to be confined and
receive the discipline of the house; and wives their husbands, for
two, three, and four years together. The allowance of food is abundant
and good; and each person is permitted to walk for a proper
time in the courts within the building, which are spacious. Every
ward is kept locked, and no one can go in or out without the especial
permission of the proper officer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Close to this place is the plantation, a very large portion of
ground within the city, laid out in avenues, and a great number of
little gardens, formed into several divisions by streets of pretty
country and summer-houses; and the whole is surrounded by canals.
To this <i><span lang="la">rus in urbe</span></i>, such of the citizens and their families repair in
the summer to dine or drink tea, whose finances, or spirit of economy
will not admit of their having a house in the country. To
render these rural indulgences as cheap as possible, three or four
families join in renting one small cottage, or perhaps a summerhouse
and garden. Never did any spot devoted to the pleasure of
nature exhibit more silence and solemnity: no sports, no pastime,
no laugh nor gambol: the females drink their tea and work, and
the men smoke in peaceful taciturnity, and scarcely move their
eyes from their different occupations, unless some very animating
and attractive object passes.</p>

<p class='c007'>In my way from the plantation to the elegant country residence
of a Dutch merchant of high respectability, I passed, a few miles
from Amsterdam, two burial places of the Jews, who wisely bury
their dead in the country; the other inhabitants follow the baneful
practice of burying in the churches and church-yards in the city,
where the catholics deposit their dead very frequently in protestant
churches. In Holland the honours of funeral pomp are scarcely
ever displayed: the spirit of economy, which seems to be the tutelar
saint of these moist regions, seldom incurs a further expense
than a plain coffin, which costs little, and some genuine tears or
sighs, which cost nothing. To describe the numerous churches,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>chapels, and conventicles of the religions of all persuasions, who
since the revolution live in cordial amity with each other, and with
the government, under which they enjoy the rights of equal citizenship,
would be a laborious and not a very interesting labour.
The quakers  here, and in every other town in Holland, are very
few: the Jews and the anabaptists are very numerous, and there
are many Roman Catholics. Before the revolution the clergy of the
established church were paid by the government; they, as well as
every other priest or pastor, are now supported at fixed salaries,
raised rateably amongst the inhabitants of the parishes in which
they officiate, each sect supporting its own minister. In every parish
registers of births, marriages, and deaths are regularly kept.
The church-yards are not disgraced, like ours, with low facetious
epitaphs, more calculated to make the living merry, than to lead
them to serious meditation. Each parish maintains its own poor,
under the control of a council. They have also, as with us, outdoor
poor. The sabbath is kept in Holland with the same solemnity
as in England. The great number of noble charitable institutions
in Amsterdam, in which the sick and the friendless of all
persuasions are received and cherished, without any recommendation
but that of affliction, cannot fail to impress a stranger with
admiration, though to enumerate them here would not be very
entertaining to the reader.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are several literary societies in Amsterdam, which are
supported with equal spirit and liberality. The Felix Meritis is
the principal public institute; it is supported by private subscriptions:
no money is paid upon admission; foreigners are admitted
with a subscriber’s ticket, but no native can be received unless he
is a subscriber. This place is a large building, containing some
fine apartments, particularly the music-room, which, during the
concerts, is much resorted to by the most opulent and fashionable
families, many of whom play, with the assistance of professional
performers. There are also rooms devoted to philosophy and the
arts. In the painting-room I was shown some works of the modern
Dutch painters, which were not above mediocrity; they appear
to have lost that exquisite art of colouring, which so eminently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>distinguished their predecessors. This circumstance is very
singular, considering how many ingenious artists this city has
produced, amongst whom may be enumerated the three Does,
Griffier, Schellinks, the celebrated Adrian, and William Vandervelde,
&#38;c. M. Smit, and Mr. De Winter, very opulent merchants,
have a fine collection of paintings. Mr. Van Brenton has also
a valuable cabinet, in which are the only Venetian pictures supposed
to be in Holland; and in the surgery is a noble picture by
Rembrandt.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Dutch theatre is large and handsome, and has a noble
front. On the night I was there, Madam Wattier performed: she
occupies the same place in the public estimation in Holland as the
immortal Siddons does in that of England: she is advanced in
years, but still continues to display great tragic qualities: at the
same time her manner is rather too vehement for an English auditor.
The principal dancer in the ballet was Mademoiselle Polly,
who dances with great agility. The scenery is good. During the
interval between the acts, the people quit the house, to take refreshments
and walk in the open air: upon these occasions the
national spirit is again displayed: as there is no half-price, little
boys hover round the doors, and bid upon each other for the purchase
of the re-admission tickets of those who come out, for the
purpose of re-selling them at a profit. The French theatre is small
but neat, and tolerably well supplied with performers. After the
play it is usual to go out to the Rondell, where the higher classes
of the women of the town assemble to waltz. This assembly-room,
like the spill-house of Rotterdam, is frequented by tradesmen, their
wives and their children. After hearing so much of this place, I
was greatly disappointed on viewing it. The assembly-room is
small and shabby, the music wretched, and adjoining is a small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>square court, with three or four trees in it, scantily decorated with
about a dozen lamps. Such is the celebrated Rondell of Amsterdam,
which the Dutch who have never visited England contend is
superior to our Vauxhall.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a large and very agreeable party, I made an excursion
into North Holland, where we visited Brock, one of the most curious,
and one of the prettiest villages in Holland. The streets are
divided by little rivulets; the houses and summer-houses, formed
of wood painted green and white, are very handsome, though
whimsical in their shape, and are all remarkably neat. They are
like so many mausoleums, for the silence of death reigns throughout
the place. The inhabitants, who have formed a peculiar association
amongst themselves, scarcely ever admit a stranger within
their doors, and hold but little intercourse with each other. During
our stay, we saw only the faces of two of them, and those by a
stealthy peep. They are very rich, so much so, that many of their
culinary utensils are of solid gold. The shutters of the windows in
front of the houses are always kept shut, and the principal entrance
is never opened but on the marriage or the death of one of the
family. The pavement of the street is tesselated with all sorts of
little pebbles and cockle-shells, and is kept in such exquisite order,
that a dog or a cat is never seen to trespass upon it; and it
is said, that formerly there was a law which obliged all passengers
to take off their shoes in the summer when they walked upon it;
that a man was once reprimanded for sneezing in the streets; and
latterly, a clergyman, upon being appointed to fill the church on
the demise of a very old predecessor, was treated with great shyness
by his flock because he did not (unwittingly) take off his shoes
when he ascended the pulpit. The gardens of this village produce
deer, dogs, peacocks, chairs, tables, and ladders, cut out in box. Such
a museum of vegetable statuary I never witnessed before. Brock
represents a sprightly ball-room well lighted up, without a soul in
the orchestra or upon the floor. From Brock we proceeded to
Saardam, which at a small distance seems to be a city of windmills.
The houses are principally built of wood, every one of which
has a little fantastic baby-sort of garden. Government has discontinued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>building ships of war here, which used to be a source of
great prosperity to the town; however, its numerous paper and
sawing mills employ a vast number of hands, and produce great
opulence to the place. We paid our homage to the wooden cottage
where Peter the Great resided when he came to this place to
learn the art of ship-building; it is very small, and stands in a
garden, and is in tolerable preservation. The women in North
Holland are said to be handsomer than in any other part of the
country. As I was very desirous of commencing my tour on the
Rhine, I was glad to return to Amsterdam.</p>

<p class='c007'>The climate of Holland is moist, but far from being unpleasant
or unwholesome, although some travellers have thought proper to
say it consists of six months of rain and six months of bad weather.
The principal divisions of the country are at present the
same as they were during the republic, namely, Holland, Overyssel,
Zealand, Friesland, Utrecht, Groningen, Guelderland, and
Zutphen, besides the Texel and other islands; but the king has it
in contemplation, it is said, of speedily dividing the kingdom into
ten departments. Holland contains 113 cities or large towns, 1400
villages, and nearly 2,800,000 inhabitants. The military force of
Holland amounts to about 40,000 cavalry and infantry. A population
and a force which cannot but astonish the reader, when he reflects
upon the size, soil, and position of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>I intended to have taken the treckschuyt to Utrecht, as the
river Amstel is all the way lined with the most beautiful country-houses
and grounds in Holland; but as some friends of mine in
Amsterdam obligingly proposed accompanying me, and were
strongly desirous that I should see Naarden, Soestdyke, and some
other places in our way, the boat was relinquished for the carriage.
I however recommend the traveller not to omit going to Utrecht
by water. Excellent carriages and horses are always to be procured
at a large livery stable keeper’s who resides near the
Utrecktsche Poort, or Utrecht Gate, in Amsterdam, close to the
house from which the Utrecht treckschuyts proceed: for these he
must make the best bargain he can, as he will be wholly at the
mercy of the proprietor. The inconvenience and imposition arising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>from travelling in Holland are frequently severely felt, on account
of there being no regular posting. In Amsterdam the price of a
carriage for the day is fourteen florins, and for this the coachman
provides for himself and horses. The back of our carriage towards
the horses, folded into two divisions, resting upon the fixed seat,
so that when the cushion was placed upon it, the seat was only a
little raised; thus the coach became either close or open: the
roof was fixed. In this vehicle, with a pair of good horses, we set
off for Naarden, a clean, pretty little town, and more skilfully and
strongly fortified than any other town in Holland: here the same
tranquillity reigns as in most of the other Dutch country towns.
From the ramparts, which present a very agreeable walk, there is
a fine view of the Zuyder Zee on the northern side, the water of
which being in many places very shallow, at a distance resembled
moving mounds of sand. Here, and throughout the journey, our
coachman gave the preference to coffee, of which the Dutch are
remarkably fond, instead of wine or spirits, with his dinner. From
economy, as I observed at this place and elsewhere, the middling
people keep a bit of sugar-candy in their mouth when they drink
tea or coffee, instead of using sugar in the way we do. Our host
regaled us after dinner with a volunteer dessert of some very delicious
pears, which grew in very great profusion in his garden.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this place to Soestdyke, one of the two country palaces
of the king allowed by the constitution, the roads are very sandy,
and we were obliged to take four horses. In the neighbourhood of
Naarden the country is covered with buckwheat; which, after we
had advanced about four English miles, began to undulated, and
present a very beautiful appearance. The many spires and chimnies
of villages peeping above the trees in all directions, the small
divisions of land, the neat and numerous little farm houses which
abounded on all sides of us, presented a picture of industry and
prosperity seldom seen in any other country. The sound wisdom
displayed by the Dutch in preventing the overgrowth and consolidation
of farms, cannot fail to strike the observation of the traveller,
and particularly an English one. By this admirable policy, Holland
is enabled to maintain its comparatively immense population, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>the great disadvantage of a soil far from being genial; hence it is
but little burthened with paupers, and hence the abundance of its
provision. In England, on the contrary, the farmers, grown opulent
by availing themselves of the calamities of unproductive seasons,
and consequent scarcity, have for many years past omitted no
opportunity, by grasping at every purchase, to enlarge their estates,
and hence a portion of land which, if separated into small allotments,
would give food and a moderate profit, to <em>many</em> families, is
now monopolized by <em>one</em>; and those who ought to be farmers on a
small scale, are now obliged to toil as labourers in the fields of
their employer, at wages that are not sufficient, if their families
are numerous, to prevent the necessity of their applying for parochial
aid. If some legislative provision could be effected to restrain
this monstrous and growing evil, by that ardent and cordial lover
of his country, and particularly of the lower classes of society, Mr.
Whitbread, who has laudably in parliament applied his enlightened
mind to ameliorate the condition of the poor, it would be
one of the most beneficial measures that ever received the fiat of
the British senate. I do not repine to see the farmers, or any other
respectable class of men, receive and enjoy the honest fruits of
their own enterprize and industry: I could see with less regret
all those decent and frugal habits of the farm which once characterized
the yeomanry of England superseded by the folly and
fashion of the gay and dissipated; the farmer drinking his bottle
of port instead of some cheap salubrious ale; his daughter, no
longer brought up in the dairy, returning from a boarding-school,
to mingle the sounds of her harp with the lowing of cows, or reluctantly
going to the market of the adjoining town, tricked out
in awkward, misplaced finery, with a goose in one hand and a parasol
in the other, did not the poor classes of society become poorer,
and the humble more humiliated, by the cause of this marvellous
metamorphosis in rural economy. In Holland, I was well informed,
there is not a farm that exceeds fifty acres, and very few of that
extent. There the economy observed in and about the “peasant’s
nest,” is truly gratifying: the farmer, his wife, and a numerous
progeny, exhibit faces of health and happiness; their dwelling is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>remarkable for its neatness and order throughout; in the orchard
behind, abounding with all sorts of delicious fruits, the pigs and
sheep fatten; three or four sleeky cows feed in a luxuriant adjoining
meadow; the corn land is covered with turkies and fowls, and
the ponds with ducks and geese. Such is the picture of a Dutch
farm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding the enormous tax upon land, and a tax upon
cattle per head, an imposition unknown to any other country, the
expense of contributing to the support of the dykes, the duty on
salt, and a variety of other charges, amounting to more than fifty
per cent. on the value of their land, the beneficial effects arising
from small farms and the simplicity, diligence, and economy of
the Dutch farmer, enable him to discharge those expenses, and
his rent, with punctuality, and with the surplus of his profit to
support his family in great comfort. To these causes alone can be
attributed the astonishing supplies which are sent to the different
markets. North Holland, so celebrated for its cheese, supplies
Enkuysen, upon an average, with two hundred and fifty thousand
pounds weight of that valuable article of life, and Alkmaar with
three hundred thousand, per week. In a very small space in the
isle of Amak, within about two English miles of Copenhagen, no
less than four thousand people, descendants of a colony from
East Friesland, invited over by one of the kings of Denmark to
supply the city with milk, cheese, butter, and vegetables, are enabled
to live and flourish, and continue to supply that city with
these articles. I remember being highly delighted with seeing
their dwellings and little luxuriant gardens; nor did I ever see so
many persons living within so small a space, except in an encampment.
An experienced English agriculturist who had visited
Holland, informed me that he thought the Dutch farmers did not
sufficiently dress their land. The vegetable soil is in general so
thin, that trees in exposed situations are usually topped, to prevent
their being thrown down by the wind. In that part of Holland
which I am describing, on account of its being well sheltered, there
is a large growth of wood. Upon leaving the romantic and exquisitely
picturesque village of Baren, we entered the royal chace,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>which occupies a vast track of ground in this forest. The trees are
generally poor and thin, but I saw some fine beeches among them.
On the borders of this chace are two country villas, in the shape of
pagodas, belonging to a private gentleman, the novelty and gaudy
colouring of which served to animate the sombre appearance of
the forest behind.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the evening we reached the principal inn at Soestdyke, lying
at the end of a very long avenue in the forest, chiefly filled with
young oaks, a little fatigued with the tedium produced by the heavy
roads through which we had waded; however, after some refreshing
tea taken under the trees, near the house, we proceeded to
view the palace, formerly a favourite sporting chateau of the Orange
family. A tolerable plain brick house on the left of the entrance,
composed the lodge, and after passing through a large court, we ascended
by a flight of steps to the principal entrance of this palace, if
palace it may be called, for a residence more unworthy of a prince
I have never seen. The only part of the house in any degree deserving
of notice was the hall, the sides of which were decorated
with the emblems of rural recreation, the implements of husbandry,
and all the apparatus of hunting, fishing, and shooting, tolerably
well executed. The rooms were principally white-washed, and
destitute of furniture: the windows were large, and the panes of
glass very small, fastened with lead, such as are used in cottages:
in short, the whole palace presented the appearance of a country
mansion in England of the date of Charles the First, deserted by
the family to whom it belonged, and left to the care of the tenants
who rent the estate to which it belongs. Nothing could be
more dreary and desolate. The king and queen partook of a cold
collation here a short time before I visited it, provided by the family
who rented the place of the state, and occupied it when we
visited it. I was not surprised to hear that the royal family staid
only one hour, during which they scarcely ventured out of a large
naked room at the back part of the house, called the grand saloon:
one of the young princes gave a son of the gentleman who occupied
the premises, an elegant watch set round with brilliants. I
could not help reflecting a little upon the disgust this visit must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>have given to the queen, who had just arrived from Paris, and from
all the voluptuous and tasteful magnificence of the new imperial
court. The palace is surrounded by a ditch half filled with green
stagnant water, the dulness of which was only relieved by the
croaking of a legion of undisturbed frogs. The gardens and
grounds, which abounded with hares, are very formally disposed
into dull, unshaded, geometrical walks. After supper, a brilliant
moon and cloudless night, attracted us into one of the most beautiful
and majestic avenues of beeches I ever saw, immediately opposite
the palace: as we sat upon a bench, looking through an opening
upon the bright bespangled heavens, the description of our
divine bard stole upon my mind:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>—Look how the floor of heaven</div>
      <div class='line'>Is thick inlaid with patterns of bright gold!</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s not the smallest orb, which thou behold’st,</div>
      <div class='line'>But in its motion like an angel sings.</div>
      <div class='line in22'><cite>Merchant of Venice</cite>, Act I. Sc. 1.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In this wood are several genteel country-houses, many of
which were formerly occupied by those who belonged to the
Orange court. The inn here is much frequented, the accommodations
of which are good, by the people of Amsterdam, who
frequently make parties to it; and it is the great resort of those
married couples fresh from the altar, until the honey-moon is in
her wane.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the morning about five o’clock we set off for Zeyst, or
Ziest, and passed through a large tract of champagne country,
interspersed with short brushwood, the dull monotony of which
was at last relieved by a vast pyramid, erected by the French
troops who were encamped in the immense open space in which
it stands, amounting to 30,000 men, under the command of Gen.
Marmont. On the four sides are the following inscriptions:</p>

<h3 class='c016'>INSCRIPTION ON THE GRAND FRONT.</h3>

<p class='c017'>“This pyramid was raised to the august Emperor of the
French, Napoleon the First, by the troops encamped in the plain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>of Zeyst, being a part of the French and Batavian array, commanded
by the Commander in Chief, Marmont.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>INSCRIPTION ON THE SECOND FRONT.</h3>

<h4 class='c018'><em>Battles gained by the Emperor.</em></h4>

<p class='c017'>“The battles of Montenotte, de Dego, and Millesimo, of
Mondovi, the passage of the Po, the battle of Lodi, the engagement
of Berguetto, the passage of the Mincio, the battles of

  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c018'>INSCRIPTION ON THE THIRD FRONT.</h4>

<p class='c017'>“He terminated the civil war; he destroyed all cabals, and
caused a wise liberty to succeed to anarchy; he re-established

prosper, he ameliorated the condition of the soldiers, the general
peace was his work.”</p>

<h4 class='c018'>ON THE FOURTH FRONT.</h4>

<p class='c017'>“The troops encamped in the plains of Zeyst, making part of
the French and Batavian army, commanded by the General in
Chief Marmont, and under his orders, by the Generals of division,
Grouchy, Boudet, Vignolle, the Batavian Lieutenant, General
Dumonceau, the Generals of Brigade, Soyez, &#38;c. [here follows a
long list of the names of the other officers, too tedious to enumerate;
also a very long list of the different divisions of the regiments
to which the above officers belonged,] have erected this
monument to the glory of the emperor of the French, Napoleon
the First, at the epoch of his ascending the throne, and as a token
of admiration and love, generals, officers, and soldiers, have all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>co-operated with equal ardour: it was commenced the <em>24th Fructidor</em>,
12 ann, and finished in <em>thirty-two days</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole was designed by the chief of the battalion of engineers.
The total height of this stupendous monument is about 36
metres, or 110 French feet; that of the obelisk, exclusive of the
<i><span lang="fr">socle</span></i>, is about 13 metres, or 42 French feet. One end of the base
of the pyramid is 48 metres, or 148 feet. From the summit of the
obelisk the eye ranges over a vast extent of country, Utrecht,
Amersfort, Amsterdam, Haarlem, the Hague, Dordrecht, Leyden,
Gorcum, Breda, Arnheim, Nimeguen, Bois le Duc, Cleves, Zutphen,
Dewenter, Swol, and a great part of the Zuyder Zee, may
be distinctly seen on a fine clear day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon this spot it is in contemplation immediately to erect a
new city, the building of which, and the cutting of a canal to be
connected with the adjoining navigation, have already commenced.
Zeyst is a very handsome town, or rather an assemblage of country-houses, it abounds with agreeable plantations and pleasant
woods, and is much frequented in the summer by the middling
classes of wealthy merchants from Amsterdam, who sit under the
trees and smoke with profound gravity, occasionally looking at
those who pass, without feeling any inclination to move themselves:
what an enviable state of indifference to all the bustle and broil of
this world! upon which they seem to gaze as if they were sent
into it to be spectators and not actors. Who, upon reflection and
sober comparison, would not prefer this “even tenour” to the peril
of the chace and the fever of dog-day balls!</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal hotel here is upon a noble scale, the politest attentions
are paid to strangers, and the charges are far from being
extravagant. The only striking object of curiosity in the town is a
very spacious building, formerly belonging to Count Zinzendorf,
and now to a fraternity of ingenious and industrious Germans,
amounting to eighty persons, who have formed themselves into a
rational and liberal society, called the Herrenhuthers, or Moravians.
This immense house, in its object, though not in its appearance,
resembles our Exeter ’Change, but infinitely more the splendid
depot of goods of every description, kept by a very wealthy
and highly respectable Englishman of the name of Hoy at Petersburgh.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Upon ringing at the principal entrance, we were received
with politeness by one of the brotherhood, in the dress of a layman,
who unlocked it and conducted us into ten good sized rooms, each
containing every article of those trades most useful, such as watchmakers,
silversmiths, saddlers, milliners, grocers, &#38;c. Many of
these articles are manufactured by the brethren who have been
tutored in England, or have been imported from our country. The
artificers work upon the basement story, at the back of the house,
and no sound of trade is heard; on the contrary, the tranquillity of
a monastery pervades the whole.</p>

<p class='c007'>After inspecting the different shop-rooms, it will repay the
trouble of the traveller to make interest to see the other part of
the premises, shown only upon particular application. The refectory
is a large room, kept with great cleanliness; and the meals
of the fraternity, if I may judge by so much of the dinner as was
placed upon the table, are very far from partaking of the simple
fare of conventual austerity. A <i><span lang="fr">bon vivant</span></i> would have risen from
their table without a murmur. In this room were several music-stands,
used every other evening at a concert; the vocal and instrumental
music of which is supplied by certain members of the
brotherhood, who I was told excelled in that elegant accomplishment.
In the chapel, which was remarkably neat, there was an
organ, and on the wall was a very energetic address from one of
the society upon his retiring from it, handsomely framed and
glazed. The dormitory upon the top of the house partook of the
same spirit of cleanliness and order. Never was any sectarian association
formed upon more liberal and comfortable principles. In
short, it is a society of amiable, industrious, and agreeable men,
who form a coalition of ingenuity and diligence for their support,
and benevolently remit the surplus of their income, after defraying
their own expenses, to their brethren established in the East and
West Indies, and other parts of the world. They marry whenever
they please; but those who taste of this blissful state are not
permitted to have chambers in the house, although they may
contribute their labours, and receive their quota of subsistence
from it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>After we had amused ourselves with roving about this
agreeable place, we set off for Utrecht. I have before mentioned
the manner in which the Dutch compute distances, and although
I had for some time been accustomed to hear hours substituted for
miles, yet as I was no longer on the canals, it sounded somewhat
strange to hear a charming lady of our party observe, which she
did with perfect Dutch propriety, when we were speaking of the
probable time in which we should arrive at Utrecht: “Surely our
horses must be poor indeed if they cannot go six hours in <em>three</em>.”
Our road lay through a very rich and beautiful country, well drained,
abounding with neat compact little farms, orchards, wood plantations,
the lofty and venerable towers of Utrecht appearing full
in our view all the way. We passed by the mall, which has a
handsome stone entrance, is upwards of a mile in length, and is
bordered with a triple row of trees, with a carriage-road on each
side. When this city surrendered to the arms of Louis the Fourteenth
in 1672, he was uncommonly delighted with this walk, yet,
from knowing that it was equally admired by the citizens, he
threatened to have every tree felled to the ground, unless they
raised a very large contribution, which was immediately produced,
and the mall preserved. If the menace of the conqueror was sincere,
which I can scarcely believe, he united the tasteless barbarism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>of a Vandal to the ferocious rapacity of a tyrant. Louis overran
this province, and the greatest part of Guelderland, Overyssel,
and Holland, at the head of one hundred thousand men, in less than
a month, a rapidity of victory almost incredible, though infinitely
surpassed by the arms of France in the present times. The progress
of the French king was celebrated in the following gasconade:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Una dies Lotharos, Burgundos hebdomas una,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Una domat Batavos luna, quid annus erit?</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I think Utrecht one of the most beautiful cities in Holland,
next to the Hague, which it is said to exceed in size. The streets
are wide, and the buildings handsome, amongst which the hand of
the Spanish architect is frequently to be traced. The canals are
about twenty feet below the street; and the access to them for the
servants of the adjoining houses is by a subterranean passage.
These canals are very much neglected, and were covered in all
directions with cabbage-stalks, leaves, and other vegetable substances,
left to putrefy upon the surface. There I first beheld a
branch of the Rhine unmingled with other waters. This mighty
river has partaken of the mutability to which every thing sublunary
is subjected. Near the village of Cooten, about twelve miles
from Utrecht, the traveller may contemplate corn waiving and cattle
depasturing where once it rolled its broad majestic waters, now
diminished to a little streamlet: its division into the two great copious
and navigable streams takes place a little above Nimeguen:
the right branch retains the name of the Rhine; the left is called
the Waal, a word expressive of a defensive boundary, which separated
the ancient Batavians from their hostile neighbours on
the southern border: the former, during its superabundance, produced
a small branch called the Lack, which ran near the little
city of Wyk, by Deurstede, directed its course towards Utrecht,
upon which it bestowed the name of <i><span lang="la">Ultra trajectum</span></i>, passed
through Woerden Leyden, and disembogued itself into the German
Ocean at Catwyk: the latter branch in rolling its waters toward
the sea, incorporated with the Maas, and their united streams
were called the New Maas, under which name they flow by Dort,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Rotterdam, and other cities, into the sea. Had rivers tongues, as
poets feign they have, this much-injured branch of the Rhine
might have exclaimed with Wolsey, I now am left</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>——to the mercy</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Upon the subsiding of a great inundation, the frequent terror
of the Low countries, it was found that the Rhine had changed its
channels, and flowed into that of the Lack, to which it had given
birth, in consequence of its channel having been amazingly deepened
by the watery irruption. This branch, in consequence of the
power of its waters not being able to bear down the obstructions
opposed to it, is not able to force its way to the sea, and is stopped
in its course near the village of Catwyk by mountains of accumulated
sand, and being compelled to regurgitate, is distributed over,
and lost in the neighbouring canals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The French, under Louis the Fourteenth, retained possession
of Utrecht for little more than a year, during which the magnificent
monarch was so delighted with the place, that he held his
court here in great gaiety and splendor; but the Dutch were
heartily rejoiced to be relieved of this honour, and hailed with exultation
the hour in which with his troops he retired from the
country; this movement however, was preceded by the demolition
of their fortifications, raising heavy contributions, and exercising
many wanton acts of cruelty and oppression, which excited such
disgust, that nearly all the inhabitants of the province resolved
upon transporting themselves to Batavia. Although by this conquest
the French had left an indelible impression of disgust behind
them, and the regular forces of the town amounted to seven
thousand men, and the inhabitants breathed nothing but vengeance
against the Prince of Orange, this city surrendered to the arms of
Prussia, who espoused his cause, in the year 1787. The rhyngrave
of Salm, who had the command of the troops, covered himself
with great disgrace, by this unresisting, cowardly, and, as it was
generally believed, treacherous surrender of the place. In 1795,
when the French troops once more approached the town, its gates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>were again thrown open, and they were received more as brethren
than as conquerors; but the inhabitants very soon repented of this
second visit, for the impositions they levied were extremely severe,
and the French officers selected the best rooms in the best houses
for their quarters, to the great inconvenience of families so oppressed.
Upon two or three doors of very elegant mansions I saw little
boards fastened, with the names and rank of the French officers
who had taken up their lodgings within. The cathedral must once
have been an enormous and magnificent structure, if I may judge
by the doom or tower, the only part which remains perfect. The
ruins present a fine specimen of the Gothic, some of the ornaments
of which were in high preservation, and very beautiful. In the
cloisters there is an arch, the pillars of which are apparently fastened
with ropes, which upon examination prove to be done in
stone, and admirably executed. The tower is of the astonishing
height of 464 feet, and from the top, on a clear day, no less than
fifty-one walled cities and towns may be seen; and the pyramid
erected in honour of Napoleon at Zeyst presents a noble appearance
in this expanded view. About midway in our ascent, we entered
a vast vaulted chamber with galleries in it, in which two old
women reside, who, if they require it, supply the visitors with
schidam and biscuits to refresh themselves in their ascension,
which are presented to them in a little room, the windows of which
are scarcely visible to the beholder on the outside, commanding a
very wide and agreeable prospect. Upon top of the tower there is
a very numerous and fine-toned set of chimes. The ramparts are
about four miles round the tower, and afford a very agreeable and
picturesque walk. Utrecht was once a rich and powerful see, the
bishops of which were sovereign princes, who laying the crosier
aside, and assuming the sword, frequently waged bloody warfare
with their rivals the prince bishops of Leyden.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same causes which have thinned the number of students
of Leyden, have reduced those of Utrecht, which do not exceed
360, most of whom are the sons of the inhabitants of the city.
Two-thirds of the merchants of this place have connexions with
London. There are several endowments of a charitable nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>which do honour to the city, many of which were originally instituted,
and principally supported by English families resident here
before the revolution. A botanic garden has lately been formed
near the dome of the cathedral; it is upon a small scale, but appeared
to be well arranged. In one of the gardens close to the city,
was a naked little statue of Cupid, without arrows or wings, with
the following beautiful inscription under it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

</div>

<p class='c007'>In the gardens of Chantilly, the little god appears in the same
manner, and is celebrated in the same exquisite lines.</p>

<p class='c007'>A traveller can scarcely enter a town in Holland which has
not given birth to some genius, whose fame reflects lustre upon
his country. Utrecht enrols amongst those illustrious sages who
resided, or were born within its walls, and who have bestowed
upon it immortal celebrity, the learned Gronovius, the critic;
Grævius, his pupil, one of the most profound writers of the middle
of the sixteenth century, so well known for his Thesaurus Antiquitatum
et Historiarum Italiæ, in thirteen folio volumes, and the
two erudite Burmans. Doctor Johnson thus speaks of Peter Burman,
and Gronovius, and Grævius, “One of the qualities which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>contributed eminently to qualify Grævius for an instructor of youth,
was the sagacity by which he readily discovered the predominant
faculty of each pupil, and the peculiar designation by which nature
has allotted him to any species of literature and by which he was
soon able to determine that Peter Burman was remarkably adapted
to classical studies, and to predict the great advance he would
make by industriously pursuing the direction of his genius. On
the other hand, animated by the encouragement of a tutor so celebrated
as Grævius, Peter Burman, by continuing the vigour of
his application, fulfilled his master’s prophecy; and it has been
asserted, that he passed honourably and fairly through the classes,
and was admitted into the university at the age of thirteen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His biographer allows this to have been so stupendous a progress
as to surpass the limits of all probability; of which indeed every
man must be sensible, who considers that it is not uncommon for
the highest genius in our country, to be entangled for ten years
in those thorny paths of literature, which Burman is represented to
have passed in less than two. But this prodigy has been cleared up
very satisfactorily by the following observation. In the universities
of foreign countries, they have professors of philology or humanity,
whose employment is to instruct the younger classes in grammar,
rhetoric, and languages; nor do they engage in the study of
philosophy, till they have passed through a course of philological
lectures and exercises, to which in some places two years are
commonly allotted: whereas the English scheme of education,
which, with regard to academical studies, is more rigorous, and
sets literary honours at a higher price than that of any other
country, exacts from the youth who are initiated in our colleges
a degree of philological knowledge sufficient to qualify them for
lectures on philosophy, which are read to them in Latin, and to enable
them to proceed in other studies without assistance; so that it
may be conjectured that Burman, at his entrance into the university
of Leyden, had no such skill in languages, nor such ability of
composition, as are frequently to be met with in the higher classes
of an English school; nor was perhaps, at that time, more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>moderately skilled in Latin, and taught the first rudiments of
Greek.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At Utrecht was also born, in 1459, pope Adrian VI. to
whom the emperor Maximilian entrusted the education of his son,
Charles the Fifth, and who afterwards filled the pontifical throne
with piety and learning, with dignity and mildness: this distinguished
personage, after having acquired his classical knowledge
at the university of this city, and his philosophical at the college
of Louvain, received the degree of doctor in divinity in 1491,
the expense of which he was unable to sustain, and which was
defrayed by Margaret, sister to Edward IV. of England. I was
informed that the house he resided in, a fine Gothic building, was
still standing, and that it was adorned with several curious basso-relievos,
but time would not permit me to visit the venerable remains.
This city had also the honour of producing the Chevalier
Antonio More, who was born here in 1519, where he studied
under John Schoorel, with whom, having made considerable progress,
he improved himself in design at Rome, and in the true
principles of colouring at Venice: one of his historical compositions,
from the subject of the Resurrection, was in such high estimation
as to be publicly exhibited at the fair at St. Germains, before it
was purchased by the prince of Condé. More has the reputation
of having imitated nature very closely and happily; his manner is
strong, just, and bold, and in his portraits there is great character
and life. He was much esteemed by the emperor Charles V. and
was by him sent to Portugal to paint the portraits of the king, the
queen, who was the sister of the emperor, and their daughter,
afterwards the queen of Spain. For these portraits he received six
hundred ducats, and many valuable presents; and to show their
admiration of his talents, the Portuguese nobility presented him,
in the name of that order, with a chain of gold valued at a thousand
ducats. He was employed by most of the princes of Europe, and
at every court his paintings excited universal applause. Queen
Mary the First of England, presented him with a chain of gold
and a pension. Upon his quitting London and settling in Spain, a
singular circumstance befel him: one day as the king, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>very fond of him, and his great patron, was talking to him in a
very familiar manner, he gave More in jocularity a sharp tap on
the arm, which the irritable painter mistaking for indignity, instead
of an act of good humour and condescension, resented by striking
the king with his maulstick: a folly which had nearly in its consequence
proved fatal to him, and which compelled him to quit
the country with all possible celerity. His last work was the Circumcision,
intended for the cathedral church at Antwerp, but
which he did not live to finish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cornelius Poelemburg, another artist of high distinction, was
born at Utrecht in 1586. He first studied under Abraham Bloemart,
and afterwards, upon going to Rome, became enamoured
with the works of that divine artist, Raphael, whose exquisite grace
in the nude figure he endeavoured to imitate. His style was entirely
new, and he surpassed all his contemporaries in the delicacy
of his touch, in the sweetness of his colouring, and in the selection
of fortunate objects and situations. His skies are clear, light,
and transparent; and his female figures, which are generally represented
naked, are equally elegant and beautiful. The Italians
were highly delighted with his works, and some of the cardinals
of Rome, of the finest taste, frequently attended his painting-room,
to observe his extraordinary and happy manner of working. Upon
his leaving Rome, the grand duke of Florence paid him great
honours, and he was received with distinction in every city through
which he passed. It is recorded to the honour of Rubens, that after
paying him a friendly visit, and expressing the greatest pleasure
from examining the works of Poelemburg, he purchased and bespoke
several of his pictures, for his own cabinet; this noble conduct
at once gave the stamp of currency to the works of the latter,
and advanced his reputation and his fortune together. Our refined
and munificent Charles the First invited him to his court, and
nobly recompensed him for his labors, but he vainly endeavoured,
by his princely encouragement, to prevail upon him to settle in
England; the indelible love of his country prevailed over every
other consideration, and he returned to his native country, where
he lived in affluence and esteem, and where he continued to paint to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>the last day of his life, which was in the year 1660, at the great
age of seventy-four.</p>

<p class='c007'>Utrecht seems to have the fairest pretensions to have given
birth to Anthony Waterloo, before slightly mentioned; an honour
disputed with much ardor of rivalship by Amsterdam and other
cities. The landscapes of this admirable artist are in the highest
estimation, and are the closet copies of nature, without the aid of
meretricious decoration. His favourite subjects were woody scenes,
embellished with water, and figures and cattle added by Weenix
and other artists: the variety in the verdure of his trees and grounds,
the very tint of which illustrates the hour of the day and the season
of the year in which they were taken, and the wonderful transparency
of his water, remain unrivalled. Although the works of this
great artist produced high prices, he expired in great penury in the
hospital of St. Job, near Utrecht. John Glauber, called Polidore,
another eminent artist, was born here in 1656: he was a disciple of
the admirable Berghem, but a passion for travelling induced him to
quit his master, to contemplate the sublime objects of nature in Italy.
In his way he remained at Paris one year with Picart, a flower
painter, and at Lyons two years with Adrian Vander Cabel, with
whom he intended to have staid longer, had he not been attracted
by a great number of people who were going to the jubilee, to
proceed direct to Rome, where he continued for two years, indefatigably
pursuing the means of improving himself in his art, and
from thence he went to Venice. Upon his return to Holland he
settled at Amsterdam, where he lodged with Gerard Lairesse, in
whose house an academy of arts was established. These distinguished
artists were united together by the same passion for their
art, and the same elevation of mind, improved by their having travelled
through the same countries: by this friendship the beautiful
landscapes of Glauber became enriched by the graceful figures of
Lairesse. Glauber ranks amongst the finest landscape painters of
the Flemish school. The most frequent subjects of his pencil he
derived from the neighbourhood of Rome and the Alps, and
his style resembles that of Gaspar Poussin; his colouring is warm
and true, his invention very luxuriant; and although his pictures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>are exquisitely finished, they appear as if they had been produced
with perfect facility; his touch is so peculiarly just and natural,
that every distinct species of trees or plants may be distinguished
by the characteristic exactness of the leafing. The two brothers,
John and Andrew Bott, were born in this city in the beginning of
the sixteenth century; the former a landscape painter, and the
latter a painter of figures: they both resided many years in Italy.
John made Claude Lorraine his model, whose style he imitated
with uncommon success, as did Andrew that of Bamboccio. They
were much attached to each other, and painted in conjunction:
their united efforts seem to be the happy result of one masterly
hand. Andrew was unfortunately drowned in one of the canals of
Venice whilst with his brother, in 1650, who returned to Utrecht
overwhelmed with grief, which he consoled by an unabated pursuit
of the art he adored. The works of John are of inestimable
value, and eagerly sought after by connoisseurs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gallantry forbids my passing over the name of Anna Maria
Schurman, born here in 1607: she was profoundly versed in languages,
displayed great skill and taste in painting, as well as in
every other branch of the graphic and elegant arts: she was honoured
with a visit from Christina, queen of Sweden, who pronounced
the most enthusiastic encomiums on her elegant attainments.
This celebrated woman died at the age of seventy-one. There are
other artists who do honour to this their native city, but I have
mentioned those of the first order, in number and reputation perfectly
sufficient to establish the pretensions of Utrecht to high rank
in the roll of renowned cities. I quitted this beautiful place, the
prosperity of which has suffered much by the war with England,
about four o’clock on a beautiful autumnal morning, and proceeded
to Arnheim, which and Nimeguen, are the capital cities of Guelderland.
This beautiful and valuable province contains twenty-two
considerable towns, and upwards of three hundred villages. The
Menopii Gugerni, Usipetes, and Secambri, mentioned in Cæsar’s
Commentaries, are supposed to have been its ancient inhabitants.
Guelderland, remarkable for the salubrity of its climate and the
fertility of its soil, abounds with the most romantic variety of scenery,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>mountain and valley, and is well stocked in every direction
with fine cattle, and abounds with game. All the way to Arnheim
the eye was gladdened by some of the most delightful objects
descriptive of the amenity of nature. In this country I generally
travelled in post-chaises, or as it is called, extra-post; but perhaps,
as the following information respecting the route from Amsterdam
to Cologne may be serviceable to those who travel by the
diligence or post-waggon, I shall insert it:</p>

<p class='c007'>We were serenaded all the way by nightingales, which are
very numerous in every part of this province. Arnheim or Arnhem,
is a very large and elegant city, partly watered by a branch
of the Naas, over which are several draw-bridges, from which there
are many agreeable views. The houses are in general well built,
and, what is remarkable for a Dutch town, very few of them out
of the perpendicular. The entrances, called St. Jan’s Poort and Sabel’s
Poort, are picturesque. St. John’s church is a vast edifice of
brick, with two spires, and a fine set of carillons; but with exception
to its magnitude, there is little in or about it worthy of observation;
the same may be said of the church of St. Nicholas. The
church near Walburges Plain, the name of which I have forgotten,
is a prodigious massy pile; and beheld from the surrounding
scenery has a very noble effect. The market-place is capacious,
and abundantly supplied with every species of provision, which
are here much cheaper than in the other parts of Holland. The
streets of this city are enlivened by several handsome equipages,
and throughout the place there is a considerable appearance of
refinement and opulence. Here the Dutch language begins to lose
itself in the German, a circumstance made manifest by a friend of
mine, a native of Germany, who accompanied me on my return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>from that country to Holland, finding considerable difficulty in understanding
the lower people in Arnheim. The inns here are in
general very good. This city gave birth to the celebrated David
Beck in 1621, a disciple of Vandyke, from whom he imbibed that
exquisite style of colouring and penciling which belong to his
school. King Charles the First was so astonished at the freedom
of his hand, he one day said, “I do believe, Beck, you could paint
if you were riding post.” The person of this artist was remarkably
handsome, and his manners perfectly well bred: these qualities,
accompanied with such talents in his art, recommended him
to the attention of queen Christina of Sweden, who appointed him
her portrait painter and chamberlain; and under her patronage he
painted most of the illustrious persons of Europe. The following
singular event occurred to this artist in his tour through Germany.
At an inn where he stopped for the night, he was suddenly taken
violently ill, to appearance expired, and was accordingly laid out
for a corpse. His valets, who were much attached to him, sat by
his bed-side, deeply lamenting the loss of so good a master; and,
like the Irish upon such occasion, sought consolation in the bottle,
which was put about very briskly; at length one of them, who was
greatly intoxicated, said to his companions, “Come, my friends,
our poor dear master used to be very fond of his glass when alive,
suppose, out of gratitude, we give him a bumper now he is dead.”
To this jovial recommendation the rest of the servants consented.
They accordingly raised his head, and the mover of the measure
poured some of the wine into his mouth; this produced the immediate
effect of forcing him to open his eyes, which, from the excessive
drunkenness of the fellow, did not surprise him, and he
continued pouring the wine down his master’s throat until the
glass was emptied, which at last completely recovered him; and
by this accidental circumstance he was saved from a premature interment.
However, he escaped death in this violent shape only to
meet it in another, for it was generally suspected that his final fate
was effected by poison administered by some miscreant, hired for
the purpose by queen Christina, at the Hague, in revenge for his
having quitted her to visit his friends in Holland, with a determination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>never more to visit Sweden. The works of this master
are justly held in very high estimation, and he became the favoured
object of the most unbounded marks of distinction and honour.</p>

<p class='c007'>With an exception to large churches, and handsome streets,
and some pretty and well-dressed women, there is little, at least
as far as I could learn, to detain a traveller in this city, so I set off
for Wesel with all due expedition, impatient to move upon the
bosom of the Rhine.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the road, which was agreeably diversified, we met several
milk-maids, bearing their milk home in large copper vessels,
shining very bright, slung to their backs, which had a picturesque
effect. About four miles from Arnheim, just after passing a bridge
of boats at Sevenhal, I entered a small town, at the end of which
is the first barrier of the new territories of prince Joachim, grand
admiral of France and duke of Berg, a piece of history which I
first learned from a new ordinance or law, in German and French,
to regulate the safe delivery of letters, pasted upon one of the gates
of the town. In this dutchy most of the peasants are catholics,
who make a public avowal of their faith by pointing a large white
cross on the outside of their houses. On the left, within a short
distance of the frontier of prince Joachim’s territory, upon the
summit of a mountain, are two large religious houses for monks
and nuns. A little indisposition, in addition to the heat of a very
sultry day, prevented me from quitting the carriage to visit the
holy fraternity and sisterhood, of whom, I was informed, very few
members remain, and those far advanced in life. The revolution of
France, and the progress of the French arms, have at least the
merit of having prevented the immolation of many a lovely young
creature, possessed of every personal and mental charm to gladden
this chequered life of ours.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>The approach to these convents from the town is by a pleasant
avenue of trees, their situation must be very agreeable, from the
extensive prospect which they command. On our right the spires
of the city of Cleves, on the French side of the Rhine appeared,
and produced a very pleasing effect. Upon turning the base of the
hill on which the monastic mansions stand, we entered upon a deep
sandy road, and a very flat and uninteresting country, in which
very few objects occurred to afford any gratification to the eye.
The Rhine occasionally appeared, but not to much advantage:
the majesty of its breadth is obscured by the great number of
islands upon it in this stage of its descent. Flink, whom I have
mentioned in describing the Stadt-house at Amsterdam, was born
at Cleves in 1616. This able artist was destined, like our celebrated
Garrick, for the bureau of a compting-house; but his genius and
passion for painting overcame all the impediments placed in their
way by paternal authority, and the persuasions of friends, and he
renounced the prospect of accumulating immense riches by commerce,
for the glory of the art. He made great progress under
Rembrandt, whose style he imitated to perfection; he soon rose to
distinguished reputation, and was employed to paint the portraits
of princes and illustrious personages of the times in which he
flourished; he died very young and much regretted.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a tedious and unpleasant journey I reached Wesel, a
large, gloomy, and very strongly fortified town: as the gates had
been closed at eight o’clock, and it struck eleven as I passed the
last draw-bridge, it was with some difficulty and delay that I was
admitted. Only persons travelling extra-post and in the post-waggon,
or diligence, are admitted after the gates are once shut.
This place presents a disgusting contrast to the neatness and cleanliness
of the towns in Holland. The moment I passed the gates, a
most offensive <i><span lang="fr">mauvais odeur</span></i> assailed my nose on all sides. There
is only one tolerable inn in the whole place, and that is generally
very crowded. If the traveller cannot be accommodated there, he
will be marched, as I was, to a pig-stye, or a house of ease to the
former, where he may meditate at leisure on the sapient poetical
advice of Shakspeare:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Cease to lament for what thou canst not help.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Here, according to a regulation which prevails in every part
of Germany, I was annoyed by being presented with a printed
paper, containing several columns, titled as follow:</p>

<table class='table1'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c010'><i><span lang="de">Nahme</span></i></td>
    <td class='c025'>Your name.</td>

    <td class='c025'>How long you intend to stay.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c015'>All of which I duly answered in writing, except the last interrogatory
but one, namely, “where are you going?” under which
I peevishly wrote, “to sleep,” consolidated into one word, in large
close letters. To an Englishman unaccustomed to such examinations,
which after all are little more than formal, although every
innkeeper by law is obliged to make such report of every traveller
on his arrival, they are very liable to excite an inverted blessing
upon the heads of those who trouble him in this manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wesel is an abominable dunghill, very strongly fortified. In
the course of my perambulations through the town, the objects
which I met with were infinitely more offensive to the sense of
smelling than gratifying to that of seeing, and doubly disgusting
from the contrast of exquisite cleanliness which the country I had
just quitted, exhibited. This part of Westphalia is very flat, barren,
sandy, and dreary, presenting little more than thin patches of
buckwheat. The roads are very heavy, and with an exception to an
oratory in a little grove, and three wooden effigies as large as life,
representing the crucifixion, not one enlivening or interesting object
presented itself. I mention the following travelling anecdote
by way of caution to my reader, should he select this route. At
Dinslaken, one of the post towns between Wesel and Dusseldorf,
the post-master told me that two horses would not be sufficient in
such roads for the carriage, and declared his determination, that
unless I took three, I should have none. If I had submitted to
this imposition here, I must have done so throughout; I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>therefore obliged to compound with this extortioner in office, by
paying half of a third horse, which sum went into his pocket, and
pursued my route with a couple, who conducted me in very good
style to the next post town. In every part of Germany the postmasters
are appointed by, and are under the control of the reigning
prince of Turn and Saxis, the hereditary director and post-master
general of the roads in that part of Europe. My driver
stopped to give his horses some wretched hard bread, used by the
peasantry in Westphalia, composed of straw and oats, called <i><span lang="fr">bonpournikel</span></i>
from the following circumstance. Many years since a
Frenchman, travelling in this country, called for bread for himself,
and upon this sort being presented, he exclaimed, <i><span lang="fr">C’est bon
pour Nikel</span></i> (the name of his horse); upon which the old woman
who had brought it in ran about the village in a great pet relating
the story.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I was proceeding by moon-light, a German gentleman who
had travelled some way with me was observing, that throughout
Westphalia a robbery upon the highway had not been known for
many years, and that a traveller was as safe in the night as in the
day; and at the moment when he had just finished an animated
eulogium upon the invincible honesty of the people, I happened
to observe the shadow of a man behind the cabriolet, the head
of which was raised, apparently very busy in endeavouring to cut off
our trunks, which, upon our jumping out, proved to be the case;
the fellow was much alarmed by our appearance, fell upon his
knees, and declared that he belonged to Dusseldorf, and poverty
had prompted him to quit that city, and try his fortune on the
highway. Nothing could exceed the indignation of the German
the moment he knew that our prisoner was a Westphalian; had
he fortunately announced himself as a native of any other country,
I believe he would have rather relieved the fellow’s distress, than
pierced his ears, and perhaps his heart, with the bitter reproaches
he heaped upon him: however, as the affair furnished me with a
hearty laugh, I prevailed upon my companion to forgive the poor
wretch, whose face and clothes indicated extreme wretchedness,
and permit him to depart in peace; and we proceeded without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>further interruption to within a short stage of Dusseldorf, where
we slept.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appearance of Dusseldorf at a little distance is very handsome,
particularly from the <em>Grand ducal road</em>, as it was styled.
Upon my driving up to the principal inn, the maitre d’hotel with
great pomp came out, and informed me in bad French that his
house was then nearly full; that the grand Dutchess from Paris was
expected every day; that his bed-rooms would be wanted for those
belonging to the court who could not be accommodated at the palace,
and, finally, that he could not receive me. As I immediately
guessed his object, I told him that I intended to stay some days at
Dusseldorf. “Oh, very well,” said he, archly adding, “you are an
Englishman I perceive.” “No, sir, an American.” “Oh,” replied
he, “never mind, it is the same thing: walk in, sir, and we will
see what we can do for you.” This inn, the only eminent one in
town, is spacious and handsome, and the table d’hote excellently
supplied with a great variety of dishes, both at dinner and supper,
perfectly well dressed. During my stay I was known by no other
name than that of Monsieur Anglois, an appellation not very gratifying
to me, upon reflecting that I was a sojourner in the territory
of a brother-in-law of Napoleon, who, knowing that he is no
favourite with the English, dislikes England and every thing that
can remind him of it, to such a degree, that an English gentleman
and lady, whom I knew, who had been detained prisoners of war
in France, but were afterwards liberated, upon their route from
Verdun to Holland to embark for their country, were one day
overtaken by a <i><span lang="fr">gen-d’arme</span></i> dispatched express from the last post
town, to order them to turn out of the high road on which they
were travelling, and to take another route which he pointed out,
by which they were compelled to make a deviation of seventy
miles. In consequence of the French Emperor being expected to

<p class='c008'>Dusseldorf, so called from the little river Dussel that
waters its southern side, and Dhorpf which means village, is now
the capital of the imperial dutchy of Berg, under the new dynasty
of the Bonaparte family: it formerly belonged to the German
empire, and afterwards to the elector Palatine, who at one period
made it his residence; this city owed the prosperity which it
long enjoyed, to the sagacity and liberality of the elector Joseph
William, who enlarged it in 1709, by nobly offering its freedom,
and an exemption from all taxes for thirty years, to every one
who would build a house within its walls, and took every judicious
advantage of its local adaptation to trade, and established universal
toleration in religion; the benefit of measures so worthy of
the Christian and the ruler was speedily felt, and Dusseldorf,
from a petty village, soon became a flourishing city, and contained
a population of 18,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Few towns have suffered more from the calamities of war than
this: its streets, squares, and houses, denote its former consequence;
it now resembles a mausoleum half in ruins. Early in the
year 1795, the army of the Sambre and the Meuse suddenly crossed
the Rhine, and summoned the city to surrender, which it refused
to do; in consequence of which the French bombarded it, and
set fire to one of its most beautiful churches, which was burnt to
the ground; and the city palace, which contained many noble apartments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>very nearly experienced the same fate; naked walls blackened
with smoke, are all that remain of this splendid pile, except
that part of it which contained the celebrated gallery of paintings,
which were removed to Munich under a Prussian escort. The
French at length took the city by assault, the Austrians who
were garrisoned within it having previously retired. I was surprised
to find that the French had spared the statue erected as a
mark of public gratitude, in the centre of the court of the gallery,
to the honour of the elector John William, who was its founder. He
commenced it in the year 1710; but dying in 1716, the completion
of this princely and public-spirited design was totally neglected
by his successor Charles Phillip, who employed part of his
treasure, and the whole of his taste, in improving the city of
Manheim. Charles Theodore, his successor, finished this institution,
established an academy of drawing and painting in Dusseldorf,
and also erected a public gallery of paintings at Manheim,
which were open to every one, and every artist had permission
to study and copy them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ruins of the palace have a melancholy appearance from
the water, on which I made a sketch of the city, when I saw for
the first time one of the Rhenish flying bridges, the description
of which I shall reserve for a few pages following, as I did not go
on board of it. That famous gallery, which attracted men of taste
from distant parts of Europe, occupied that part of the palace
which stood close to the junction of the Rhine and the Dussel,
and was divided into five very large and spacious apartments, one
of which was wholly devoted to one picture of Gerard Douw,
esteemed inestimable, and one of the finest he ever painted; the
subject of it is uncommonly complicated, yet every figure in it is
so exquisitely finished, that it will bear the closest inspection. Descriptions
of paintings are seldom very interesting; but the subject
of this renowned picture deserves to be recorded. It represented
a quack-doctor at a fair, upon his stage covered with a Turkey
carpet, set out with vials and gallipots, a shaving bason, an umbrella,
and a monkey: the doctor, in the most whimsical dress, is
haranguing with uncommon humour and cunning in his countenance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>the motley crowd below; amongst whom, a gardener
wheeling a barrow filled with vegetables, a countryman with a
hare hanging over his shoulders, a woman with a child at the
breast, baking little cakes for the fair; another woman listening
with ardent credulity, whilst a sharper is picking her pocket, are
penciled in a wonderful manner. Douw has represented himself
looking out of the window of a public house, and drawing the
several objects. The second chamber contained the productions
of the Italian school; a third those of the Flemish: a fourth was
dedicated to Vanderwerff; and the fifth to Rubens.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only part of the city which presented any appearance of
animation was the market-place, which abounded with fine vegetables,
and exquisite fruit. The market-women, and the female
peasants, wear a large handkerchief depending from the top of the
head, which has a picturesque effect. Fruit is so abundant that for
the value of 3<em>d.</em> I purchased a pound and a half of the most luscious
grapes. In this square, part of the scaffolding used for illuminating
the hotel de ville, on the grand duke making his first entry
into the city, remained. About a mile from the town is a country
palace of the prince, separated from a garden, in front of it, by the
great road to Cologne. The palace is large, and very elegantly
furnished; the gardens are spacious, well kept, and open to well-dressed
persons. The view of the city from these walks is very
beautiful. The ramparts, which are levelling as fast as the pickaxe
and spade can lay them low, in many places present a very
agreeable walk.</p>

<p class='c007'>All religions are tolerated, but that most followed is Roman Catholic,
for the celebration of which there are three large churches;
before one of them, raised and railed off, is a group as large as
life, in wood, painted white, representing our Saviour crucified between
the two thieves, and Mary Magdalen, kneeling; several persons
were praying very devoutly before those images. The dead
are wisely buried out of the city. In one of the streets at the extremity
of the town, is a prodigious pile of buildings for barracks.
The soldiers of the grand duke, principally Germans, and a few
French, had a very military appearance. The manufactures are at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>a pause; the population is reduced to about eight thousand persons,
the greater portion of whom are in very abject circumstances.
How different must this place be to its former period of prosperity,
before the last war, when a gay old Prussian officer who resided
there, told me, that it was enlivened with clubs, casinos, and
balls, when every family of common respectability could regale
its friends with the choicest Johannis-Berg Hockein-Rheideshein
wine. The princes of Germany differ very much from those of our
own country, in the plain and unostentatious manner in which they
move about. One morning, when I was crossing the court of my
inn to go to breakfast, I saw a little boy fencing with a stick with
one of the ostlers: as I was pleased with his appearance, I asked
him if he was the son of the maitre d’hotel, to which he replied,
“No sir, I am the hereditary prince Von Salm.” The prince and
princess, his father and aunt, were at the same hotel, having come
to Dusseldorf to pay their respects to Prince Murat. The grand
ducal court was, as I was informed, kept up with considerable
splendor, in the circle of which the grand dutchess, one of the
sisters of Napoleon, had not yet made her appearance. It was
generally believed, notwithstanding the use my worthy host made
of her approaching entry, that no great attachment existed between
the grand ducal pair; and that the gaiety of the imperial
court of Paris possessed more prevailing attractions to the grand
Dutchess than her own. Murat, grand Duke of Berg, is an instance
of the astonishing results of great ability and good fortune.
His origin was so very obscure, that very little of it is known.
The following anecdote will, however, throw some light upon the
extreme humility of his early condition in life. After his elevation
to the rank of a prince of the French empire, he halted, in the
close of the last war, at a small town in Germany, where he stayed
for two or three days; and on finding the bread prepared for
his table of an inferior kind, he despatched one of his suite to order
the best baker in the town to attend him, to receive from him
his directions respecting this precious article of life. A baker who
had been long established in the place was selected for this purpose;
and upon the aide-de-camp ordering him to wait upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>prince immediately, he observed, to the no little surprise of the
officer—“It is useless my going, the prince will never employ
me.” Upon being pressed to state his reasons, he declined assigning
any; but as the order of the messenger was peremptory,
he followed him, and was immediately admitted to Murat, with
whom he stayed about ten minutes, and then retired. As he quitted
the house in which the prince lodged, he observed to the aide-de-camp,
“I told you the prince would not employ me—he has
dismissed me with this,” displaying a purse of ducats. Upon being
again pressed to explain the reason of this singular conduct,
he replied, “The Prince Murat, when a boy, was apprenticed to
a biscuit baker in the south of France, at the time I was a journeyman
to him, and I have often threshed him for being idle; the
moment he saw me just now, he instantly remembered me, and
without entering into the subject of our ancient acquaintance, or
of that which led me to his presence, he hastily took his purse of
ducats from the drawer of the table where he sat, gave it to me,
and ordered me to retire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroic courage which Murat displayed in the campaign
of 1797, when in conjunction with Duphoz, at the head of their
respective divisions, they plunged into the deep and impetuous
stream of Tagliamento, gained the opposite banks, and drove the
Austrians, headed by their able and amiable general, the Archduke
Charles, as far as the confines of Carnithia and Carniola; and
the numerous battles in which he distinguished himself in Egypt,
and afterwards at Montebello and Marengo, where at the head of
his cavalry, he successfully supported the brilliant and eventful
movement of Dessaix, will rank him in the page of history amongst
the most illustrious of those consummate generals, which the fermentation
of the French revolution has elevated from the depths
of obscurity. In Egypt he was high in the confidence of Napoleon,
whom he accompanied with Lasnes, Andreossi, Bessieres, and
several members of the Egyptian Institute, when Bonaparte effected
his memorable passage from his army to Frejus, in August
1799. Upon the death of General Le Clerc, who was united to a
sister of Napoleon, Murat paid his addresses to, and espoused his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>widow,<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c021'><sup>[3]</sup></a> with the entire approbation of his great comrade in arms,
by whom he was, upon his elevation to the imperial throne, created
a prince of the empire, and at length raised to the rank of a
sovereign. He is reserved and unostentatious, and is seldom visible
to his people. Some of the Westphalians, who are attached to
the ancient order of things, have a joke amongst themselves at the
expense of their new prince, whose christian name being <em>Joachim</em>,
they pronounce it with an accompanying laugh, <em>Jachim</em>, which
means “<em>drive him away</em>;” and there is very little difference in the
pronunciation.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. This is a mistake of the author. Prince Murat married Napoleon’s
youngest sister, who had not been previously married. Le Clerc’s widow
is married to Prince Borghese.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Dusseldorf had infinitely less charms for me than it had for
the grand Dutchess, I was as well pleased to quit it, as she was
disinclined to enter it; so mounting my cabriolet, for which I was
obliged to make the best bargain I could with the post-master, I
set off for Cologne, the road to which is far more pleasant than
any other part of the dutchy which I saw, though the whole is very
flat. About six miles from Dusseldorf, I passed a beautiful country
palace of the grand Duke, called Benrad, composed of a range of
semicircular buildings detached from each other, standing upon
the summit of a gentle slope, at the bottom of which is a large circular
piece of water. The grand Duke makes this place his principal
residence, and very seldom goes to that in the neighbourhood
of the city more than twice in the week, to give audience
and transact affairs of state, which, as the government is entirely
despotic, are managed with ease and despatch. The appearance of
the body-guard at the entrance announced that the prince was at
this place when I passed it: the grounds and gardens, seen from
the road, appear to be tastefully arranged. Although the road is
sandy, yet it is infinitely preferable, I was informed, to crossing
the ferry at Dusseldorf, and proceeding by that route to Cologne.
After passing Muhlheim, a very neat town, the suburbs of which
are adorned with some handsome country-houses, I entered, about a
mile further, the village of Deutz, and beheld the venerable city
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>of Cologne, separated by the Rhine, immediately before me. At
one end of the village is a large convent of Carmelites, and on the
day of my arrival a religious fête was celebrating, at which nearly
all the population of the place and neighbourhood assisted, and
the streets were enlivened with little booths, in which crosses and
ornaments of gold lace and beads were tastefully exposed to the eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bell of the flying bridge summoned me on board, and in
about five minutes I found myself in the French empire, attended
by French custom-house officers in green costume, who conducted
me to the Douane. This ferry cannot fail to impress the mind
and excite the curiosity of a stranger: it is formed of a broad platform
resting upon two large barges, like our coal lighters; from
this platform a vast wooden frame in the shape of a gallows is
erected, which is fastened to the former by strong chains of iron,
whilst from the centre cross piece, a chain of the same metal of
great length, is fixed to the top of an upright pole standing in each
of a long line of boats, the remotest of which is at anchor; by
this machinery a powerful pressure is obtained; to each of the
barges a rudder is affixed, which, upon being placed in an oblique
direction, produces a lateral motion upon the stream, which acts
as a force from above; so that by changing the rudder to the
right or left, the bridge is forced on one side or the other of the
river, with equal certainty and celerity. Fifteen hundred persons
can with perfect ease be transported at the same time upon these
bridges, and carriages and horses are driven upon them without
any stoppage, from the banks, to which they are lashed, until put
in motion. The Germans call this machine the Fliegende Schiffs-Brücke,
or the volant bridge of boats; the Dutch geer burg, or
the bridge in shackles, in allusion to its chains; and the French le
pont volant, or the flying bridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The search made by the custom-house officers amongst my
fellow-passengers, most of whom had only just crossed and recrossed
the river, was very rigorous; the females were marched
up to a small house, where, as I discovered by accidentally opening
the door, and offending as the elders did when they took a lawless
peep at Susanna, to the no small delight of those who were lounging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>without, and of embarrassment to those within, they underwent
a private examination by two matrons, appointed for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this place I expected some difficulty; but upon my declaring
myself an American, and showing my pass, and just opening my
trunk, the officers, with great politeness, called a porter to carry
my luggage into the city, and pulling off their hats, recommended
me to La Cour Imperiale, one of the best hotels, where I arrived
just in time to sit down to a splendid table d’hôte, at which several
beautiful and well-dressed ladies, German noblemen, and French
officers, were present.</p>

<p class='c007'>This city was formerly celebrated for the number of its devotees
and prostitutes, which the French police has very much reduced.
The first object I visited, was the cathedral, which, from the water
appears like a stupendous fragment, that had withstood the shock
of war, or some convulsion of nature, by which the rest of the pile
had been prostrated; but upon inquiry, I found that it owed its
mutilated appearance to no such event, but to the obstacles which
have occurred for ages in completing it, according to its original
design. In the year 1248, Conrad, the elector and bishop of Hocksteden,
in the pride and exultation of holy enthusiasm, resolved to
erect a temple to God, which should have no equal in size and
magnificence; it was intended that the two western towers should
have been five hundred feet in elevation, and the nave or body of
the church in proportion, and every external stone which the eye
could perceive, decorated with the most exquisite ornament of
pure gothic architecture. The successors of the prince bishop,
who resembled in the splendor of his spirit the emperor who so
elegantly wished to leave the town <em>stone</em>, which he had found <em>brick</em>,
continued the building for two centuries and a half; but owing to
their resources being insufficient, they were obliged to leave it in
a very imperfect state, but capable of being used for religious
purposes. There is no building of the kind to compare with it,
but the Duomo at Milan. One of the western towers, which I
ascended, is about two hundred and fifty feet high, from which
there is a fine view of the city, the Rhine, and the surrounding
country; the other tower is not above forty feet high. The roof
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>of the greater part of the body of the church is temporary and
low; but so spacious is the area which it covers, that one hundred
massy pillars, arranged in four rows, present a light and airy
appearance upon it. My guide, who was a good humoured intelligent
man, with many significant shrugs of regret, informed me,
that the moveable decorations of the church and altar were once
worthy of a stranger’s attention; but that the generals of the French
armies, during the revolution, had pillaged this holy sanctuary of
its richest ornaments; however, the grand altar in the choir was
not sufficiently portable for their rapacious hands, and remains to
show the magnificent scale upon which every part of the cathedral
was originally designed. This altar is formed of one solid block, of
the finest sable marble, sixteen feet long and eight broad, placed
upon the summit of a flight of steps.</p>

<p class='c007'>The treasury, or as it is called the golden chamber, contains
the robes of the priests, which are very magnificent, arranged with
great care and order in several ward-robes; and busts of saints and
holy utensils in gold and silver, many of which were once encrusted
with the most precious stones, but which had been removed
by the French, and their places supplied by paste. Amongst
the still costly contents of this chamber, I noticed a small tomb of
a priest in solid gold and silver, and a skull of St. Peter, of the
same precious metal. In this room were several ladies, who appeared
to be under the strongest influence of Roman Catholic enthusiasm;
not a robe or a relic was exhibited, which did not draw
forth some fervidly pious exclamation.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was shewn, as a marvelous curiosity, the mausoleum of the
Three Kings, behind the grand altar towards the east, where the
bodies of these personages, and those of the martyrs, Gregory of
Spoleto, and Felix Nabor, repose. The bones of the three kings
are said to have been brought away by the emperor Frederick
Barbarossa, when he sacked Milan, and presented to the archbishop
Bernauld of Dassalde, who attended him in his military
exploits, and who deposited them near Bonn, from whence they
were transferred to the spot where their mausoleum was afterwards
erected, before the building of the present cathedral in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>year 1170: the bones of these personages, of course, performed
all sorts of prodigies; the blind by touching them, became astronomers,
and the lame, dancing masters. This tomb, before the
last war, was uncommonly rich and magnificent; but the French,
who have displayed no great respect for living kings, could not be
expected to pay much to three dead ones, and accordingly they
have stripped their shrine of most of the jewelry, and precious
ornaments. The sacrilege committed upon three holy kings, who
were transported so far from their native country, reminds me of
an anecdote, in which the playful wit of Mr. Hastings, formerly
governor-general of India, was eminently displayed. An antiquary
having collected in India a considerable number of Hindoo gods,
had them well packed up for the purpose of being sent to England,
and on the top of the case wrote in large characters “Gods—<em>please
to keep these uppermost</em>;” the governor-general calling one
morning on the collector, observed the package in his library, and
remarking the superscription, said, “your direction is a wise one,
for when you transport gods into a foreign country, it is ten to
one but that they are <em>overturned</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Every street reminds the stranger of the former prevalence
of the priesthood. Before the war, the clergy in this city, were divided
into eleven chapters, nineteen parishes, nineteen convents
for men, and thirty-nine convents for women, besides forty-nine
chapels, institutions which supported between two and three thousand
persons in useless voluptuousness and sloth.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the other churches have been stripped of their finery, and
were not embellished by any striking work of the statuary, I
merely took a cursory view of their exterior: the principal are the
Jesuits’ church, the collegiate church of St. Gerion, that of the
Maccabees, and the abbey church of St. Pantaleon: all these and
a number of other sacred buildings useless to name, abounded with
saints and shrines incrusted with a profusion of jewellery, and all
the mummery and mockery of cunning and credulity. With respect
to the chapel of St. Ursula, a whimsical circumstance occurred
some years since: in this depositary, for a great length of
time, have reposed the bones of the immaculate St. Ursula, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>eleven thousand virgins her companions, who came from England
in a little boat in the year 640, to convert the Huns who had taken
possession of this city, who instead of being moved by their sweet
eloquence and cherub-like looks, put an end to their argument by
putting them all to death. Some doubts arose many years since
whether any country could have spared so many virgins, and a
surgeon, somewhat of a wag, upon examining the consecrated
bones, declared that most of them were the bones of full grown
female mastiffs, for which discovery he was expelled the city.
The convents and monasteries are converted into garrisons for the
French troops quartered in the city. It is in contemplation to pull
down about two-thirds of the churches.</p>

<p class='c007'>On account of its numerous religious houses Cologne was called
the Holy city. Bigotry, beggary, and ignorance disfigured the
place in spite of its once flourishing trade and university. When
the French seized upon this city, in 1794, they soon removed the
rubbish of ages; three-fourths of the priests had the choice of retiring
or entering the army, and when withdrawn, the weak minds
over which they had exercised sovereign influence recovered their
tone, and lived to hail the hour of their delivery from fanatical bondage,
and the sturdy beggars were formed into conscripts. One of
the most illustrious of the archbishops of Cologne was Theodoric,
who was much celebrated in his time for his talents, erudition and
morals. An anecdote is related of him, that upon the emperor
Sigismund one day asking him how to obtain happiness hereafter,
as the possession of it seemed impossible, Theodoric replied,
“You must act virtuously, that is, you should always pursue that
plan of conduct which you promise to do whilst you are labouring
under a fit of the gravel, gout, or stone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This city is celebrated for having given birth to Agrippina the
mother of Nero, but it has derived more lustre from the immortal
Rubens having been born here in 1640: the house in which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>resided is still preserved and exhibited with great pride to strangers.
This illustrious man was no less a scholar than a painter,
and hence his allegorical works are more purely classical than
those of any other master: of this the gallery of the Luxembourg
and the banqueting-room at Whitehall bear ample testimony.
Whilst he painted he used to recite the poems of Homer and Virgil,
which he knew by heart, by which he infused the divine spirit
of poetry into the productions of his pencil. After having studied
a few years in Italy, his renown as an artist spread through Europe,
whilst his learning, amenity of manners, elegant accomplishments,
and amiable mind, secured to him the esteem and regard
of all whom he approached. He was particularly cherished
by the kings of England, Spain, and other monarchs: he was even
employed upon a very delicate occasion to communicate proposals
from the cabinet of Spain to that of London, and Charles I. was so
delighted with his various talents, that he conferred upon him the
honour of knighthood. The number of his paintings is prodigious.
Sir Joshua Reynolds said that the most grand, as well as the most
perfect piece of composition in the world, was that of Rubens’s picture
of the Fall of the Damned, formerly in the gallery of Dusseldorf;
that it combined such a varied, heterogeneous and horrible
subject, in such a wonderful manner, that he scarcely knew which
most to admire, the invention or the composition of the master.
The last of Rubens’s paintings was the Crucifixion of St. Peter,
with his head downward, which he presented to St. Peter’s church
in this city one day after taking a copy of the register of his birth
from its archives: the tasteless and mercenary heads of the church
received this invaluable present with little expressions of gratitude,
and were disappointed that the donor had not given them money
in lieu: when Rubens heard of their dissatisfaction, he offered them
28,000 crowns for the picture, which, merely in consequence of
the offer, they considered to be worth infinitely more, and therefore
refused to sell him the work of his own hands, and it was preserved
with great veneration in the church, where it continued till
Cologne became one of the cities of the French empire. Rubens,
to the powers and graces before ascribed to him, united the virtue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>of a christian: from motives of piety and benevolence he adorned
many churches and convents with his matchless productions;
which, as if the hallowed purpose to which they were devoted
had inspired him, whilst he painted, were generally the most
masterly efforts of his pencil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thomas à Kempis, so celebrated for his extraordinary piety,
was born in the neighbourhood of this city in 1380. The last
edition of his works is that of Cologne 1660, 3 vols. folio; his
most celebrated work was entitled ‘De Imitatione Christi;’ which,
on account of its great piety and merit, has been translated into
almost every living language. This work has been attempted to
be ascribed to an abbot of the name of Gerson, of the order of St.
Benedict, which for many years produced severe controversies
between the canons of St. Augustine, to which Thomas à Kempis
belonged, and the Benedictines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The celebrated William Caxton opened his printing office
here in 1471, and printed the work of Le Fevre, which was three
years afterwards published in London, where he had the honour
of being the first to introduce the invaluable art of printing. Adam
Schule the mathematician, who died at Pekin, was a calendar
here. Vondel the Dutch Virgil was born here, as was the wonderful
Maria Schurman, who was well versed in twelve languages,
and wrote five classically, besides excelling in every accomplishment
then known. Excess of genius and learning made her melancholy
mad, and she died from an inordinate debauch in eating

<p class='c007'>The Town House is a very ancient edifice, and contains the
only specimen of Grecian architecture in the city. There were
three ecclesiastical electorates in Germany, viz. Cologne, Mayence,
and Treves, which have been abolished by Napoleon. The
revenues of the elector of Cologne amounted to upwards of two
hundred thousand pounds. Cologne must have been declining for
some centuries, for in the year 1200 it was capable of furnishing
thirty thousand men for the field, a number which its present
population is said not to exceed. The whole of the trade of this
town was extensive before the last war, and at one period, in spite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>of its bigotted rulers, it was one of the richest and most flourishing
cities in Germany: its traders carry outward annually large quantities
of salted provisions from Westphalia, iron from the forges
of Nassau, wood from the Upper Rhine and the Neckar, wine,
hemp, tobacco, brass, tufo stone, tobacco-pipe clay, millet, gins,
dried fruits, potash, copper, ribbands, stockings, and lace: and
they purchase of the Dutch paper, oil, cottons, groceries, spices,
medicinal drugs, also for dyeing, and English lead and tin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The policy of the French government since it has assumed
a settled form, has very much directed its attention to the depressed
state of the manufactures of Cologne, which formerly
employed eleven thousand children, and under its auspices there
are several fabrics in a very flourishing condition, particularly
those for manufacturing stuffs and ribbands, and a great deal of
iron is now wrought in this city. The university is at a very low
ebb, in consequence of so many young men having embraced the
profession of arms. This university was once very celebrated, and
was the most ancient in Germany, having been founded in 1380.
Pope Urban the Sixth paid it the following compliment, in allusion
to its having given birth to the college of Louvain:</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Matre pulchra filia pulchrior.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>This maternal university was divided into theology, law, medicine,
and philosophy; but has not the only celebrity of having sent
into the world many enlightened men.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the department of Cologne the vineyards began first to appear.
The vines in the garden grounds of the city are said to
have yielded seven hundred and fourteen thousand gallons of
wine. The wines are not attempted to be cultivated higher north.</p>

<p class='c007'>During my stay at Cologne I visited the French parades every
morning and evening. As the parades in France used to be confined
to the morning, it was natural to conjecture that some new
and great political storm was collecting, for which the French
emperor was preparing by redoubled activity and energy. At
these parades the conscripts, after having undergone a brief drilling,
were incorporated with the veteran troops: to wheel, to form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>close column, to load, fire, and charge with the bayonet, seemed
to be all the motions which were attended to. Instead of forming
the line, as with us, with exquisite nicety, but little attention was
paid to it, for a more slovenly one I never witnessed; but by thus
simplifying the manœuvres, and confining the attention of the
soldier only to the useful part of his duty, a conscript is qualified
to march to the field of battle with the rest of the troops in five
days. But little attention was paid to the dress of the men, who
wore uniform only in a short blue coat with white or red facings,
and appeared to be left at full liberty to consult their own taste or
finances in every other article, for some wore breeches, some pantaloons,
some appeared with gaiters, some without, some had
shoes, and others half-boots.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>As I gazed upon these men, whose appearance was slovenly,
I was lost in amazement, by reflecting that they were part of that
military force which had made itself terrible to so large a portion
of Europe, which in its first organization was composed of men,
many of whom had never had a musket in their hands, and commanded
by generals who had never witnessed a military manœuvre;
many of the most shining of whom had undergone an immediate
transition from the most peaceful, and even the most
subordinate occupations in life, to conduct armies to the field of
battle, to confront and rout some of the prime, veteran troops of
nations, long renowned for their eminence and military character.
Robespierre may be considered as having laid the foundation of
all the military glory of France, and by the unexampled energy
and prospective acuteness of his measures, to have accomplished
a system by which France has achieved so many brilliant victories.
No one but a tyrant, who to a sanguinary soul united profound
penetration, could have accomplished what he did. He swept
away in a deep and impetuous stream of blood the immediate
branches of the royal family, the court, its valuable and its obnoxious
appendages, and made a clear arena to act upon. In the
name of Liberty he invoked those who were favourably disposed
to her cause, and by terror he forced the reluctant to sustain the
miseries and perils of a camp. Glory or the guillotine were eternally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>before the eyes of the republican commanders, who thus
stimulated, never revolted at a profuse expenditure of life, nor
considered any victory dearly obtained, so that it was obtained: the
soldiers were all young men, amongst many of whom high ardour
and a passion for heroic enterprize, characteristic of that season
of life, prevailed, which soon spread with electric influence upon
the more considerate, prudent, and even timid part of the body.
Thus impelled, they pushed on, and soon felt their enthusiasm
redouble, upon beholding the brilliant impression which they
made upon troops inured to war and led by distinguished commanders,
who receded before them, from a conviction that they
could only hope to repel the attack by an assimilation of tactics
and a lavish waste of blood, a consideration which frequently forced
the followers of the old school to meditate when they ought
to have acted.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a remark in frequent use, that the efficiency of an army
may be measured by the skill of the general; but the French soldiers
have expanded the observation, and have exhibited the wonderful
spectacle of skilful soldiers fighting under, and frequently
enlarging the views and combinations of able generals. The animal
organization of Frenchmen befits them for soldiers; their
supple muscular form and height seldom exceeding five feet five
or six inches, admit of great activity of movement, and the support
of great fatigue: their minds quick, volatile, inquisitive, and
fertile in expedients, enable them to see the intentions of their
commanding officers in a movement, which, to the soldiers of
many other countries would only be known by results. The
French commanders knew how to gratify that national cast of intellect
so useful to their operations, by frequently imparting to a
soldier of a company, for the purpose of wider communication,
the principal movements in contemplation previous to their engaging.
The vanity of a French soldier is also another most
valuable quality in his composition: he takes the deepest interest in
the execution of every order, because he thoroughly believes that
he is acquainted with all its objects; and upon the achievement of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>a victory, there is scarcely a French drummer who would hesitate
endeavouring to make his hearer believe, that the fortune of the day
was owing to some judicious idea of his own: to this vanity the military
bulletins which announce successes in all the pomp of language,
or convert a disaster into a retrograde victory, are addressed; for
a Frenchman, even more than an Englishman, almost always believes
what he is told, and is ever the last to confess a defeat. It
is a rule with the French officers to give their troops as little trouble
as possible when not actually in service, and to keep them perpetually
upon the alert when the campaign has commenced; by
this measure their troops, contrary to a received opposite notion,
are generally fresher than other troops; and as they are mostly
composed of young men, are capable of marching more rapidly
and longer than soldiers of mixed seasons of life. The French
have another great advantage in their plan of combat, which resembles
the mode of engaging at sea, practised so gloriously by
the late immortal Nelson, that of beating against the centre of an
enemy’s line until they penetrate it; this they have several times
successfully effected, by that almost endless reinforcement which
the arbitrary levies furnish, and which in a moment supply the
vacancy made by the bullet and the bayonet. To prevent any ill
consequences from the impetuous temerity which might attend
the first attack, a considerable corps of reserve is always formed
of the more experienced troops, who are able to support their
comrades in the front, when too severely pressed, or of forcing
them to rally, should they discover any disposition to fly. To their
flying artillery, which are served by their best soldiers, wherever
the ground will best admit, they are also eminently indebted for
their success: yet, with all those advantages, striking and eminent
as they are, and the negative assistance which she derived from
the frequently imbecile conduct of the enemy, France would perhaps
never have been crowned with the success which has marked
her march, had not her population been enormous, and had
not the stupendous idea of placing a great portion of that population,
by the novelty of a conscription, at the disposal of her ruler,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>been developed by the mighty monster<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c021'><sup>[4]</sup></a> whose name I have before
mentioned. If she had had twenty thousand men on the plains
of Maida, she would have been spared the disgrace of seeing
7,000 of her chosen soldiers fly before 4,795 of the British arms
under the gallant Stuart.</p>

to be their plenipotentiaries to this effect; namely, his Majesty
the Emperor of the French, Charles Maurice Talleyrand, Prince
of Benevento, minister of his foreign affairs; his Majesty, the

bound, shall be in future null and without force, with the exception
of the statutes relative to debts, determined in the recess
of the deputation of 1803, and in the paragraph upon the navigation
to be funded upon the shipping tolls, which statutes shall
remain in full vigour and execution.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. Each of the contracting princes renounces such of his titles
as refer to his connexion with the German empire; and they will,

<p class='c014'>7. The members of the league must be independent of every
foreign power. They cannot, in any wise, enter into any other service,
but that of the states of the confederation, and its allies.
Those who have been hitherto in the service of a foreign power,
and choose to adhere to it, shall abdicate their principality in favour
of one of their children.</p>

<p class='c014'>8. Should any of the said princes be disposed to alienate the
whole or any part of his sovereignty, he can only do it in favour
of the confederates.</p>

<p class='c014'>9. All disputes, which may arise among the members of the
league, shall be settled in the assembly at Francfort.</p>

<p class='c014'>10. In this the Prince Primate shall preside, and when it shall
happen, that the two colleges have to deliberate upon any subject,
he shall then preside in the college of Kings, and the Duke of
Nassau in that of the Princes.</p>

<p class='c014'>11. The time, when the congress of the league, or either of
the colleges, shall have particularly to assemble, the manner of
the convocation, the subjects upon which they may have to deliberate,
the manner of forming their conclusions, and putting them
in execution, shall be determined in a fundamental statute, which
the Prince Primate shall give in proposition, within a month after
the notification presented at Ratisbon. This statute shall be approved
of by the confederated states; this statute shall also regulate
the respective rank of the members of the college of princes.</p>

shall receive a pension according to the situation they have held.</p>

<p class='c014'>33. The numbers of military or religious orders who shall lose
their incomes, or whose common property shall be secularised,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>shall receive during life a yearly stipend proportioned to their
former income, their dignity, and their age, and which shall be
secured upon the goods of the revenues of which they were in the
enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c014'>34. The confederates renounce reciprocally, for themselves
and their posterity, all claims which they might have upon the possessions
of other members of the confederation, the eventual right
of succession alone excepted, and this only in the event of the
family having died out, which now is in possession of the territories
and objects to which such a right might be advanced.</p>

<p class='c014'>35. Between the Emperor of the French and the Confederated
States, federatively and individually, there shall be an alliance,
by virtue of which, every continental war in which one or either
parties shall be engaged, shall be common to all.</p>

<p class='c014'>36. In the event of any foreign or neighbouring power making
preparations for war, the contracting parties, in order to prevent
surprise, shall, upon the requisition of the minister of one of them
at the assembly of the league at Francfort, arm also. And as the
contingent of the allies is subdivided into four parts, the assembly
shall decide how many of those shall be called into activity. The
armament, however, shall only take place upon the summons of
the Emperor, to each of the contracting parties.</p>

<p class='c014'>37. His Majesty the King of Bavaria, binds himself to fortify
Augsburg and Lindau; in the first of these places to form and
maintain artillery establishments, and in the second to keep a
quantity of muskets and ammunition, sufficient for a reserve, as
well as a baking establishment at Augsburg, sufficient to supply
the armies without delay, in the event of war.</p>

<p class='c014'>38. The contingent of each is determined as follows:</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Since the peace of Presburgh all our attention and all our care
have been employed to fulfil with scrupulous fidelity all the engagements
contracted by that treaty, to preserve to our subjects
the happiness of peace, to consolidate every where the amicable
relations happily re-established, waiting to discover whether the
changes caused by the peace would permit us to perform our important
duties, as chief of the Germanic empire, conformably to
the capitulation of election.</p>

<p class='c014'>The consequences, however, which ensued from some articles
of the treaty of Presburgh, immediately after its publication,
which still exist, and those events generally known, which have
since taken place in the Germanic empire, have convinced us that
it will be impossible, under these circumstances, to continue the
obligations contracted by the capitulation of election; and even if
in reflecting on these political relations it were possible to imagine
a change of affairs, the convention of the twelfth of July,
signed at Paris, and ratified by the contracting parties, relative to
an entire separation of several considerable states of the empire,
and their peculiar confederation, has entirely destroyed every
such hope.</p>

<p class='c014'>Being thus convinced of the impossibility of being any longer
enabled to fulfil the duties of our imperial functions, we owe it to
our principles and our duty, to renounce a crown which was only
valuable in our eyes whilst we were able to enjoy the confidence of
the electors, princes, and other states of our Germanic empire,
and to perform the duties which were imposed upon us. We declare,
therefore, by these presents, that we, considering as dissolved
the ties which have hitherto attached us to the states of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Germanic empire; that we, considering as extinguished by the
confederation of the states of the Rhine, the charge in chief of the
empire; and that we, considering ourselves thus acquitted of all
our duties towards the Germanic empire, do resign the imperial
crown and the imperial government. We absolve, at the same
time, the electors, princes, and states, and all that belong to the
empire, particularly the members of the supreme tribunal, and
other magistrates of the empire, from those duties by which they
were united to us as the legal chief of the empire, according to
the constitution.</p>

<p class='c014'>We also absolve all our German provinces and states of the
empire from their reciprocal duties toward the German empire;
and we desire, in incorporating them with our Austrian states as
Emperor of Austria, and in preserving them in those amicable
relations subsisting with the neighbouring powers and states, that
they should attain that height of prosperity and happiness which
is the end of all our desires, and the object of our dearest wishes.</p>

<p class='c014'>Done at our residence, under our imperial seal,</p>

<p class='c014'>Vienna, the 6th of August, 1806.      FRANCIS.</p>

<p class='c014'>We, Francis Second, &#38;c. In abdicating the imperial government
of the empire, we, considering it as the last effort of our care,
and as an absolute duty, do express thus publicly a desire equally
reasonably and just, that the persons who have hitherto been employed
in the administration of justice, and in diplomatic and
other affairs, for the good of the whole empire, and for the service
of the chief of the empire, should be suitably provided for:</p>

<p class='c014'>The care which all the states of the empire took of those persons
who lost their places by the affair of the indemnity in 1803,
induces us to hope that the same sentiments of justice will be extended
to those individuals who have hitherto been employed in
the general service, who have been chosen in all parts of the
Germanic empire, and many of whom have quitted other profitable
places, looking forward to an honourable subsistence for life,
and which should not be wanting to them on account of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>fidelity, and the integrity and capacity with which they have executed
their functions:</p>

<p class='c014'>We have, therefore, taken the resolution of preserving to
those of our imperial servants, who have hitherto drawn their salaries
from our chamber, the same appointments, reserving to ourselves
to place them in employments in the service of our hereditary
states; and we hope, with so much the more confidence,
that the electors, princes, and states will provide for the imperial
chamber of justice of the empire, and the chancellerie of the
chamber of justice, by charging themselves voluntarily with this
expense, as it will be trifling in amount, and will diminish every
year.</p>

<p class='c014'>As to the chancellerie of the aulic council of the empire, the
funds destined for its support will be employed to provide for the
wants of those individuals who have hitherto drawn from thence
their salaries; this will serve them until other measures may be
taken.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>In consequence of having been informed the preceding evening
that an imperial decree had passed, by which strangers entering
the French empire were permitted to bring as much money
into it as they chose, but were not suffered to take out of it more
than what certain officers appointed for that purpose considered
necessary for the prosecution of their journey, the surplus passing
in the nature of a forfeiture to the crown, I concealed about thirty
ducats, which fell within this description of overplus, in my cravat,
and at five o’clock in the morning, marched from my hotel to the
bureau des diligences par eau, a distance full two English miles,
to be searched for this superfluity of cash, previous to my ascending
the Rhine. At this house a scene took place which perhaps
has not often occurred to travellers, in consequence of the temporary
apprehension which it excited, the ridiculous situation in
which it placed me, and the retributive chastisement which it inflicted
for thus venturing upon an hostile shore. I was introduced
into a room looking upon the Rhine; at the bureau sat the Director,
a man who wore spectacles, with a strongly marked, expressive
countenance, apparently about fifty years of age; upon my
bowing to him he demanded of me, in German, who I was? I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>requested him to address me in French, which he did, repeating
the question. I told him I was an American going to the Francfort
fair, upon which he put down his spectacles, and running up
to me, squeezed my hand with a violence of compression infinitely
more painful than agreeable, and exclaimed in very good English,
“How happy is this day to me! for I too am an American.” I was
obliged to return the affectionate salutation, and also to express
my delight in having, so far from our native home, met with a
countryman. He then asked me from what part of America I
came? “From Baltimore,” was the answer. “Happier and happier!”
cried he renewing his embrace, “for I was born there
too.” At this moment I wished, for the first time in my life, all
the force of the <i><span lang="la">amor patriæ</span></i> at the devil; but there was no time
to be lost in meditating upon the peril and awkwardness of my
situation. To prevent, as much as possible his interrogating me
further about my adopted country, I addressed with all possible
fluency, as many questions as I could suggest respecting Cologne,
the Rhine, the war; in short, I touched upon every subject but
what had an American tendency. To my observations he bowed,
to my questions he gave very brief answers, and continued expressing
his delight in seeing me, a delight which was very far
from being reciprocal. After ordering his servants to bring breakfast
for me, which I did not decline, although I had already taken
that meal at my hotel, for fear of offending him, he made many inquiries
after some persons whom he named, and mentioned to be of
the first consequence in Baltimore. I gave him to understand that I
had left the city when quite a boy; but upon his assuring me that I
must remember or have heard of the persons he had named, I
gave him to understand that my recollection of them was very
imperfect, but that I believed they had perished by the yellow
fever; upon hearing which he expressed great affliction, observing
they were the dearest friends he had in Baltimore before he
quitted it, about fifteen years since. In this uncomfortable situation
I sat vis-à-vis with my tormentor, who continued, during
breakfast, to overload me with expressions of kindness. At last
the skipper of the Rhine boat made his appearance, with the welcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>information that the boat was ready, upon which the director
ordered him to make up a bed for me on board if I wished it,
and to show me every possible attention, adding, that I was his
particular friend and countryman. I now thought the hour of my
deliverance was arrived, and that an adventure which promised so
adversely would terminate in the display of the civilities I have
enumerated; but it was determined that my correction was not
yet sufficient, for as the director looked out of the window, he exclaimed,
“here comes my secretary, a very steady young man,
who can attend to the office for the day,” and then turning round
to me, added, “and I can now have the happiness of going half a
day’s journey with you, which I am resolved to do; yes, I will show
to you how dear my countrymen are to me, by going as for as Bonn
with you.” Distressed and embarrassed beyond measure at this
fresh proof of his provoking and perplexing regard for America
and me, I tried in vain to prevail upon him not to think of carrying
his politeness so far, and expressed my strong sense of the attentions
with which he had already <em>completely overwhelmed</em> me: all
that I urged appeared only to redouble the warmth of his expressions,
and to confirm him in his determination.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a heavy heart and a light countenance we walked arm
and arm down to the shore, and ascended the boat, over which, as
well as all the other Cologne passage boats, it appeared he had
complete sovereignty by virtue of his office, and in a minute afterwards
the towing horse advanced at a rate of about two English
miles and an half in an hour on the French side of the river.
The director made me sit next to him in the cabin, telling the
passengers, who appeared to be very respectable, that I was an
American and his countryman, and that that was the happiest day
he had experienced for fifteen years. In the course of conversation
with him, from the gasconade stories which he related of his
own exploits, I was induced to entertain suspicions of his character;
he told me that he was one of the most conspicuous characters
in the French revolution; that General Custine owed all his
glory in the field to him; that he had long resided at Berlin, where
he had, by his intrigues, maintained for some time a complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>ascendency in the Prussian cabinet; that he was engaged in a vast
literary work, in which all the great events that had agitated the
world for the last ten years, would be unfolded in a manner never
before developed; that he had entered into the service of the
French Emperor, solely to promote the interest of the empire.
He observed, after engaging my word to keep the matter secret
until I reached my own country, that the Emperor was abhorred
throughout the empire, that he was a remorseless tyrant, and that
<em>he</em> could prove him to be a coward.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the latter part of his assertion I took care to offer no remark,
but under the pretence of wishing to view the city of Cologne
at a distance, the river and the country, and also to gain a
little respite from such a rapid succession of untoward circumstances,
I ascended the top of the cabin and refreshed myself by
making the sketch engraved. The tower, the mighty mass of the
unfinished cathedral, the numerous spires, the shores on either
side, the rapid motion of the vessel descending the Rhine, the
singing of those on board, the clear brilliancy of the sky, afforded
reanimating delight to my mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>About ten o’clock my persecutor raised his head through the
cabin door, to announce that dinner was ready, and to request my
company: upon descending I found some soup, and beef roasted
after the German fashion, and that the director had, while I was
above, been taken ill, from the occasional agitation of the boat,
that to allay his sickness he had asked one of the gentlemen on
board for some brandy, and of which he had evidently taken a
great deal too much: the spirit rapidly operated upon his head,
and a more abominable nuisance in the shape of man I never beheld:
incapable of sitting at table with such a miscreant, I resumed
my old place where I had not been seated long before I heard
him abusing all the passengers, except myself, for whom he again
expressed “the assurance of his high consideration,” and threatening
to order them all to be thrown overboard, which he seemed
to be perfectly able to do himself, for he was one of the most powerful
men I ever beheld: upon which they relinquished the cabin to
himself, and, excepting a very pretty French girl, came upon deck.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Upon hearing her scream violently, I went below to see what <em>influence
his countryman</em> could now have over the director: as I was handing
her out of the cabin, he forcibly pulled me back, closed the
door, and said, in a manner which was perfectly intelligible,
though occasionally interrupted by the spasms of intoxication, “I
know you, though you think I do not; you are <em>no American</em>, you
are an Englishman, and a son of Mr. Erskine the orator; you are
here on a secret mission, and your life is in my hands, but I will not
betray you.” The reply I made was, “I am engaged in no secret
mission, my soul would revolt at it, nor can I be the son of my
Lord Erskine, for he is now upon the ocean, as ambassador from
the court of Great Britain to my country;” to which I added,
“that it was in vain for him to attempt to deceive me any longer,
for I was satisfied, by his observations respecting America, that
he had not been born in that country:” to which, to my no little
consternation, he replied, “No, nor have I ever been there, I am
a German by birth, I was educated by an Englishman who lived
at my father’s, and I am now in the service of one of the greatest
heroes, and the most illustrious of men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I know not whether my life was in peril, but it is certain my
liberty was, and to preserve it, I thought that something should
be immediately done; accordingly I ascended the top of the cabin,
where all the passengers were assembled in a state of considerable
uneasiness, from one of whom I borrowed a bottle of
brandy and a coffee-cup, with which I returned to the director,
and insisted upon drinking his health in some excellent spirit,
and raising my hand and the bottle in a manner which, in his
state, prevented him from seeing what I poured out, I affected
to fill and drink it off; I then gave him a bumper, which I several
times repeated in a similar manner, until the miscreant dropped
under the table, where he continued in a state of utter insensibility,
and with little appearance of life, until we arrived, which
we did in about six hours, at Bonn, when he was taken out of the
vessel by some men, conveyed to a house near the banks of the
river, and, thank heaven! I saw no more of him, but proceeded
with the rest of the passengers to a very neat inn a little way in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>the city, where we had an excellent dinner and some good white
Rhine wine. The stream of the Rhine became less rapid as we
approached Bonn, where its waters are shallower than in the neighbourhood
of Cologne, where all large vessels ship their cargoes
which are destined for any of the towns higher up, into craft constructed
peculiarly for the purpose, and which draw much less water.
As I determined to sleep at Bonn, I had a favourable opportunity
of seeing this beautiful little city, which enabled the former
Electors of Cologne to display their taste by selecting it for their residence.
It was elegantly and justly observed by a French lady on
board of the boat as we approached the city, <i><span lang="fr">Voilà Bonne! c’est une
petite perle!</span></i> no expression could describe it better; when I made
my view of it, the dark clouds behind it set off the pearl-like appearance
of the palace and buildings. I saw no spot on the Rhine in
the shape of a town with which I was so much delighted; it consisted
of little more than 1000 houses and 8000 inhabitants. In
the neighbourhood the country begins to undulate, and the vines
make a luxuriant appearance. The wine made here and in the
adjacent parts is tolerably good; that which grows upon the black
basalt hills, further to the southward, is infinitely preferable, black
being a powerful agent to attract and retain heat; hence the rents
of hills are rather high. So powerful is this colour in attracting
and retaining the heat, that a very intelligent friend of mine, who
resided for some time in China, informed me, that for the purpose
of ripening their fruits as early as possible, the Chinese
gardeners paint their garden walls black, and lately in some parts
of England this plan has been followed. Everything in and about
the city bears testimony to the enlightened liberality and refined
taste of the last of the Electors of Cologne, who was cordially beloved
and admired by all classes of his subjects. The building
which was once his palace, is very extensive; it stands just without
the city upon an elevation of ground, and commands a most
enchanting prospect, embracing the windings of the majestic
Rhine, part of the village of Poppledorff, the ci-devant monastery
of Gruizberg crowning the summit of a hill, and at a distance the
Seven Mountains, clothed with vineyards, and the spires of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Coblentz. This beautiful building is now applied to government
purposes; in the left wing towards the orange garden, which is
prettily disposed, the French Emperor has preserved the Lyceum
for instructing boys in Latin, Greek, German, French, mathematics,
and philosophy: the professors are very able men, and the
institution is in a flourishing condition: this is one amongst the
many noble establishments founded by the last Elector, which in
his reign was kept in another quarter of the city: this elegant
pile of building, which is now stripped of all its valuable ornaments,
was raised by the elector Clement Augustus in 1777,
upon the same site on which no less than four preceding palaces
had fallen victims to the flames: there is a beautiful walk under
a quadruple row of lime trees, which leads to a small country
palace: this walk forms the fashionable parade of the city, and
was graced by a number of beautiful and elegantly dressed ladies.
Some very pleasant French officers, with whom I was walking in
this place, expressed their surprise at seeing an Englishman
amongst them, and I was obliged to find refuge again in my
American adoption.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through a beautiful and romantic country, by a short walk a
little beyond Gruizberg, towards the south, is the picturesque
hill of Godesberg, or Godshill, so called from a sanative mineral
spring flowing close to it, which contains fixed air, iron, magnesia,
and salt: the last Elector who never omitted any thing which
could add to the comfort and happiness of his people, erected an
assembly and other rooms, and also pleasure gardens for recreation
close to the spring, and by some very wise regulations, encouraged
the building of lodging-houses. At this place, many of
the unhappy French emigrants, after the revolution, found a little
relief from the miserable recollections of their fallen fortunes and
altered fate: the court of the prince bishop was remarkable for
the elegance, hospitality, and refined freedom which reigned
throughout it, and in return in every visitor he beheld a friend.
The influence of this scene of courtly felicity upon the manners
of the people had not as yet subsided. A peculiar air of refinement
distinguished the deportment of the inhabitants: after an exquisite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>ramble, I returned through the square, a spacious irregular
area, where the French troops quartered in the place were exercising,
and where a very ancient Gothic town house stands, to
supper at my hotel, at the table d’hote of which I again smarted
for the temerity of trespassing upon this delightful spot. During
our repast, which abounded with a great variety of choice and excellent
dishes, and which was attended by many French officers, a
German lady who sat opposite to me, always addressed and alluded
to me by the perilous name of “<i><span lang="fr">Monsieur Anglois</span></i>,” which excited
some considerable attention amongst the company towards me;
at last a French officer whose physiognomy did not present the
most pleasing collection of features, rose up, eyed me all over,
and went out: I expected nothing less than being obliged to take
shelter once more under my American alliance, but after waiting
in the room an hour, I saw nothing more of him, and went to bed.
Whilst a cruel and savage state of hostility between man and man
thus embarrassed the progress of a traveller, whose only object
was to contemplate the beautiful face of nature, never did the divine
object of his pursuit appear more arrayed in the smiles of
<em>peace</em> and loveliness. The government of Bonn, as well as Cologne,
and all the other cities on the left bank of the Rhine is vested in
a governor appointed by Napoleon, and is purely military. Under
a clear and cloudless sky I bade adieu to Bonn with great reluctance,
and embarked on board of the passage-boat bound to
Cassel. As we passed the lofty towers of Plittersdorff, on our
right, the Rhine unfolded itself in all its glory. On our left the
seven mountains (Sieben Geburge) called the Drakenfels, Wolkenbourg,
Rolandsekke, Löwenburgh, Nonnenstromberg, Hoke
Ochlbey, and Hemmerick, arose with uncommon grandeur,
crowned with convents and the venerable ruins of castles. In distant
ages, many a German baron bold resided in rude dignity with
his martial followers upon the summit of these mountains, from
whence they waged war against each other, and many of their remains
of antiquity are the work of Valentinian in the fourth century,
who overthrew the Germans, and who fell a victim to his
inordinate passion, for when the Quadi sent to him to make a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>peace, the <em>awkward appearance</em> of some of the ambassadors so
enraged him, that in his anger he burst an artery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Drackensels has infinitely the advantage of situation; it rises
perpendicularly from the river to a stupendous height, crowned
with the roofless remains of an ancient castle, brown with antiquity;
midway it is covered with luxuriant vines, whilst all above
is red and gray rock. The other mountains, which recede to a
great distance, appeared to be clothed with the clustering grape,
on the opposite side the vineyards, sloping close to the water’s
edge, extended as far as they could reach; every where the genius
of this terrestrial Paradise seemed as if with tasteful finger
he had</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As we advanced, a beautiful island in the centre of the river,
covered with poplars, walnut-trees and elms, from the bosom of
which arose the roof and belfry of the monastery of Nonen
Werth, or Worthy Nuns, formed the back scene: the bosom of
the river was enlivened with the peasants of the neighbourhood
moving in boats worked and steered with paddles, and the banks
of the French territory with groups of French soldiers bathing,
and singing their national songs.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we passed the monastery the matin bells rung, and gave a
romantic interest to the scene: this pious seclusion is included
in the French line of sovereignty, and was condemned by Bonaparte
to change its owners and its nature for ever; but at the earnest
intercession of the Empress Josephine, he consented to suffer
the sisterhood to enjoy it during their lives, after which it will
devolve to the empire. Wherever power could effect and policy
justify the measure, Bonaparte has displayed his decided hostility
to monastic establishments of every description; he considers
them as so many sinks of sloth, in which all the noble principles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>and purposes of life become stagnant. In Paris only one convent, that
of the Blue Nuns, is permitted to remain. The numerous convents
which adorn the French side of the Rhine with the most picturesque
appearance, are either converted into fabrics, or suffered to
run to dilapidation: the river, from its meanderings, is land-locked all
the way, every turning of which surprised and captivated me with
some new beauty. Here, behind a line of walnut, lime and beech
trees, just skirting the margin of the river, a stupendous pyramidal
cliff appears, with every projection upon which the cultivator
could lodge a layer of vegetable mould, supporting a little
growth of vine: there, mountains of vineyards, relieved by mouldering
castles, and convents rising from masses of rock shooting
forwards, or piercing the sky from their pointed pinnacles, arrest
the attention. Sometimes a torrent brightens before the beholder,
and distantly roars upon the ear; at others the naked bed of one
appears, or a rude gap through which the eye penetrates into
ranges of other vine-clad mountains, variegated with majestic
ruins, is seen. At the base of the hills on the sides of the river
numerous towers and villages constantly appear, defended by ancient
walls and turrets, adorned with venerable churches, brown
with age, surmounted with lofty spires, every where inviting the
reflection of the moralist, the investigation of the antiquary, the
song of the poet, and the pencil of the painter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Almost all the immense mass of mountains which extend
from Bonn to Andernach, is composed of the basalt and slate; the
former has a more artificial appearance than almost any other mineral
production. In no form can it puzzle the philosopher more
than at the Giant’s Causeway, in Ireland, where it assumes a
columnar shape, which has every appearance of having been
chisseled by the hand of a skilful mason, and of having been regular
granite cooling after fusion, and formed into regular masses
by crystallization. In the small cavities of these mountains the
martins and swallows find refuge, and in a comfortable state of
torpidity pass through the cold and cheerless weather of winter.
The children of the peasantry amuse themselves in discovering
their retreats, at an apparent exposure of their own lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>In an amphitheatre of vast dusky basalt mountains, the sombre
gates, towers and pinnacles of Andernach appeared: in consequence
of the river making a long sweep, I landed with an intention
of rejoining the boat at a village named by the skipper; a
more solemn scene of gloom and grandeur, I never contemplated:
the ruins of this town towards Coblentz are of great antiquity.
The inhabitants insist upon it, that the remains of the Emperor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Valentine are deposited in one of their churches, and that Julius
Cæsar when he so victoriously fought against the Suabians,
passed over the Rhine at this spot, where Drusus the general of
Augustus, built one of those fifty castles which are erected on the
banks of the Rhine: but the French, who narrowly investigated
every part of the river which their victorious arms enabled them to
visit, with great acuteness, and with the assistance of history, believe
that this celebrated landing was effected a little higher up the river,
a short distance from Engers, at a place called the White Tower
(der Weisse Thurm), the venerable front of which I saw as I afterwards
advanced on our right, in the centre of a sudden recess
of the river, where it has the appearance of having served the
united purposes of a castle and a watch tower; at its base is a considerable
village, which formerly belonged to the Elector of
Treves: this situation is from a combination of local advantages,
peculiarly favorable to the completion of such a passage, and in
confirmation of the opinion, a great number of Roman antiquities
have been found there. General Hoche, at the head of an immense
army, aided by the obscurity of the night, crossed the
Rhine at this place in 1797, and astonished the imperial troops
the next morning by their presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was the last exploit of that general. Near this tower
there are deposited his remains, over which a mausoleum has
been erected. This young commander died of an enlargement of
the heart at Wetzlar. His funeral was conducted with uncommon
military pomp. The procession moved from the place where he
died, across the Rhine to the White Tower, amidst the discharge
of cannon, which were fired every quarter of an hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trade of the Rhine is here very flourishing, for exclusive
of the neighbouring vineyards which produce fine wines, and the
basalts of the adjoining mountains used for building and paving,
this city derives considerable wealth from the lapis tophaceus or
tuf stone, the harder sort of which form excellent millstones;
vast quantities are shipped for Holland, to construct or repair its
dykes with, and the more friable is used for building, whilst its
powder mixed with lime forms the hardest and most durable cement.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>I saw the cabins of several treckschuyts in Holland covered
with it, which were perfectly impervious to the rain: the Germans
also use it to floor their houses with. This stone is considered
to be a species of the pumice-stone, or imperfect lava,
and of volcanic production.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the banks leading to this city, I saw part of one of those
amazing floats of timber which are formed of lesser ones, conveyed
to this city from the forests adjoining the Rhine, the Moselle,
the Maine, &#38;c.; these floats are attached to each other, and form
a platform generally of the enormous dimensions of eight hundred
feet in length, and one hundred and sixty in breadth, upon which
a little village containing about eighty wooden houses is erected
for the accommodation of those who are interested in, and assist
in navigating this stupendous raft, frequently amounting to seven
and eight hundred persons, men, women, and children; besides
these buildings, there are stalls for cattle, slaughtering houses,
and magazines for provisions: the float is prevented from striking
against the shores, where the turnings are abrupt, by the application
of thirty or forty anchors, which with the necessary cables
are conveyed in fourteen or fifteen boats which precede it, and its
course is safely directed by German and Dutch pilots, who are
hired for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>After great rains when the current is rapid, the whole is entrusted
to its propelling force, otherwise several hundred persons
are employed in rowing, who move their oars at a given word of
command. The whole of these wonderful moving masses is under
the entire direction of a governor or superintendant, and several
officers under him. Sometimes they are months in performing
their voyage, in consequence of the water being low, in which
case they are obliged to wait till the river is swelled by the rains.
In this manner they float from the <em>high</em> to the <em>low</em> countries, and
upon their arrival at the place of destination, the whole is broken
up, and finds a ready market. About twelve of them annually arrive
at Dort, in Holland, in the months of July and August, where
these German timber-merchants having converted their floats into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>good Dutch ducats, return to their own country with their families,
to enjoy the produce of their labour and enterprize.</p>

<p class='c007'>The clergy and monks in Andernach used to be, to use a
good humoured homely expression of a late illustrious statesman,
upon an application made to him for a place under his administration
“as thick as five in a bed;” beside six vicars belonging to
a large parish church, there were no less than five crowded convents,
and the population did not exceed four thousand souls: the
convents are now converted into garrisons for French soldiers,
and storehouses for tradesmen. After viewing the city, I set off
on the road to Coblentz, with a view of meeting the boat at the
place appointed, and after walking about two miles, I lost all traces
of the river; however, observing about three parts of a mile off,
the tops of a long semicircular line of poplars, I concluded the
river flowed by them, and I accordingly endeavoured to penetrate
to the bank through a large willow wood, in which I soon lost myself.
At last, however, I succeeded in forcing a way into a little
footpath, in pursuing which I suddenly came upon a Frenchman,
poorly clothed in green, with a book in his hand; he courteously
addressed me, remarked that I looked rather warm, and conducted
me to a recess in the wood, close to the water, where there
was a bed of straw and a gun: at first I regarded him as a robber,
but he soon gave me to understand that he was a link in a vast
chain, composed of forty thousand soldiers, placed in this sort of
ambuscade at the distance of a gun shot from each other, by the
orders of the government of France, to guard the left bank of the
Rhine from smugglers; and that to prevent contraband practices,
no boat is suffered to pass either up or down the river after sunset,
without being fired upon; that they are always clothed in a
sombre dress, to prevent observation, and are concealed in this
manner wherever the sides of the river will admit of it. Upon
my informing him that I had lost my way and my boat, he politely
assured me that it had not yet ascended the river, and hailed a
little punt passing by, which enabled me to regain the vessel, then
very fortunately just approaching. Notwithstanding the vigilance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>of the French police, the rafts I have described carry on a considerable
contraband trade in the Rhine wines and Seltzer water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Opposite to the spot where this occurrence took place, at the
bottom of a range of hills, is the delightful town and palace of
Neuwied, built of white stone, at one end of the line of poplars
which I have mentioned, and almost the only town I saw without
walls or any sort of fortification on the Rhine. Nothing could exceed
the air of happiness and prosperity which seemed to reign in
this delectable little capital, which looked perfectly fresh and new,
the prince of which receives, because he deserves, the affections
of his subjects; every one on board, with great vivacity, spoke of
the toleration, the liberal extension of the rights of citizenship to
foreigners, and the public spirit of its ruler. The place is enriched
by several flourishing iron works, steel, paper, and cotton
manufactures (the latter, the first introduced into Germany),
printing, watch, and ingenious cabinet-making. Before the last
war, in the forges and founderies, and different fabrics, not less
than four thousand persons were employed, and their circulation
at a fair has been known to amount to forty or fifty thousand florins.
There is an establishment of Moravian brethren here more
numerous than that at Zeyst. The last and the present wars have
of course considerably reduced the number of workmen, by forcing
many of them into the army; but, notwithstanding, there is
no town on the Rhine in a more enviable condition, for every
thing which can impart content and felicity to man. It was a curious
and highly interesting circumstance to see in Neuwied and
Andernach, almost opposite to each other, the most modern and
the most ancient city on the Rhine. The price of freight upon
the Rhine is rather high: before the French united together so
many petty sovereignties it was much higher, owing to the number
of tolls which were paid to each; previous to that event there
were no less than twelve tolls to discharge between Cologne and
Amsterdam.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had a very good table d’hote on board, at a moderate
price, abundance of Rhine crabs, excellent grapes, and a variety
of other fruits, which, as well as the most delicious bread I ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>tasted, we purchased at the different towns where we stopped. I
had the comfort of being attended by an intelligent, animated fellow,
who had been in the service of the immortal Nelson on board
of one of the ships which he commanded, and afterwards with the
English army in Egypt, who offered his services on board the
boat at a very reasonable rate. The richness, novelty, and majesty
of the scenery, kept me constantly on the roof of the cabin, from
the early hour of starting till the hour of nine at night, when, for
the reason stated, we always stopped at some town or village till
morning. In these stoppages we entirely depended upon the variable
velocity of the current, not to say a word of the caprice of
our skipper, or the influence which the residence of any particular
favourite or friend might have upon him; the consequence of
which was, that we arrived at places to sup and sleep where we were
not expected, and of course our patience was put to a little, but
never a considerable trial. Within three or four miles of Coblentz,
on our right in ascending the river, we passed a pyramidical
mausoleum, erected to the memory of the French general Marceau,
who distinguished himself at the battle of Mons and Savenai,
and died of the wounds which he received at the battle of Altenkirchen
in 1796.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Bendorf, a romantic village on our left, upon a branch of the
river, a terrible battle was fought between the French army, commanded
by Gen. Hoche, and the Austrians, after the former had effected
the passage I have before mentioned, from the white tower,
which, after a tremendous slaughter on both sides, terminated in
the retreat of the imperial troops. In this battle an extraordinary
instance of prowess and enthusiasm occurred, which is said
to have decided the fate of the day; the French had frequently
attacked an Austrian redoubt, the possession of which was of
great consequence to them, and had as often been repulsed with
great carnage; at last a French general rode up to the granadiers
commanded by Captain Gros, and exclaimed, “Soldiers, swear
to me that you will make yourselves masters of that redoubt.”
“We swear,” replied Gros, holding up his hand, and his soldiers
doing the same: they returned to the attack with redoubled fury,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>and the havoc became dreadful: the French troops were upon the
point of again giving way, when their leader had his right arm
crushed by a grape shot, upon which, with a smile of triumph,
he grasped his sabre with his left, rallied his men and carried the
redoubt. As we turned a considerable meander of the river by
Neuendorff, one of the grandest spectacles I almost ever contemplated
opened upon me: the mighty rock of Ehrenbreitstein,
formerly called the Gibraltar of the Rhine, with its dismantled
batteries and ruined castles, rose with awful and unexampled
majesty on the south; at its base was the palace formerly belonging
to the Elector of Treves, and the town bearing the name of
this wonderful fortification; and immediately opposite to it, as
we advanced a little farther, the beautiful city of Coblentz appeared.
Here we were obliged to be separated from our horse,
on account of the Moselle, which discharges itself into the Rhine
at this place, the mouth of which we crossed by the assistance of
our boatmen’s poles. Over this river there is a handsome stone
bridge of many arches, and formerly there was a bridge of boats
from this city to Ehrenbreitstein, which has been most judiciously
removed, and succeeded by one of the flying bridges before described,
by which a more convenient communication is kept completely
open, and the navigation is not impeded. Coblentz is a
very ancient city; it was the seat of the Roman emperors, and of
the kings of the Franks, and a favourite residence of the archbishops
and electors of Treves, who, in ancient times of broil and
peril, resided in the castle which crowns the majestic rock opposite
to the city. Before the revolution there were three parish
churches, two colleges, a church belonging to the Jesuits, four
convents of monks, dominicans, carmelites, franciscans, and capuchins,
and three nunneries. At that period the population of the
inhabitants, of the garrison, and the vale of Ehrenbreitstein, was
calculated at 13,000 souls; at present it is not supposed to exceed
nine thousand. The city has many good and some handsome
buildings, and it is further recommended by its supplies of excellent
mines, pit-coal, wood, and lime. Its best square is the Clemenstadt;
there are several handsome hotels, of which the ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>hotel, the vast rock which formerly protected it, and the
antiquity of its buildings, cast a gloomy grandeur over the whole
place, which never exhibited so much gaiety as in the winter of
1791, when the French princes and their followers were nobly
entertained and protected here by the Elector, before they marched
to Champagne, to experience those disasters which finally confirmed
the overthrow of their devoted house.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coblentz derives its name by not a little meander of etymology,
from the confluence of the Rhine and the Moselle at its
base. Ausonius, one of the most celebrated of the Latin poets of
the fourth century, wrote five hundred verses in commemoration
of this river, which, compared with the majesty of the river into
which it rolls and is lost, is scarcely worthy of such an honour: the
view from its banks is also in an equal degree of comparative inferiority,
and by the unceasing agitation of its confluence, it has
the reputation of having alarmed the tender nerves of the river-fish,
of which the inhabitants of this city are not so well supplied
as the neighbouring towns.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most beautiful objects in this place is the new palace,
built to the south of the city, close to the Rhine, by that
splendid and amiable prince, the Elector Clemont Vencelas; it is
of brick stuccoed, to resemble stone, has a noble Ionic portico,
and including its wings, extends one hundred and eighty yards.
A further description of its exterior, as I have made a drawing of
it, and moreover as it is now converted into an hospital, were
useless. Its grand staircase, its apartments consisting of a chapel,
an audience-hall, concert-room, library, cabinet, dining-room, besides
an immense number of other rooms, excited the admiration
of every visitor, by their magnitude, magnificence, or elegance.
Its furniture, its mantle-pieces, its tapestry, and inlaid floors, all
corresponded in taste and splendor with the rest of the building;
now not a vestige of its consequence or original destination remains,
but what its walls display. Most of the windows are broken,
stuffed with hay, or further disfigured by having linen hanging
out to dry from them; the area before the grand front, which
was formed into an elegant promenade, is now broken, and its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>graceful plantation totally destroyed. A little way further to the
southward, on the opposite side, under the impending rocks of
Ehrenbreitstein, is the old palace, a sombre building, which the
Elector Clement quitted almost entirely on account of its gloom,
and the humidity of its situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Elector of Treves excited the indignation of the French
against him very early in the French revolution, by encouraging
the expatriated French princes to reside and hold their counterrevolutionary
councils at Coblentz. In September, 1794, General
Jourdan, with his accustomed energy, compelled the Austrians
to retreat to Hervé, and afterwards to Aix la Chapelle, when, supported
by the main body of the army, the French attacked all the
enemy’s posts from Ruremonde to Juliers: at this eventful period,
General Clairfayt having occupied a strong position upon the
Roer, resisted the French for some time, but their ardor and
numbers at length compelled the Austrians to retire into Germany,
leaving behind them ten thousand of their comrades, killed
or taken prisoners, in the short space of three days; and soon afterwards
a detachment of the French army, under the command
of General Moreau, entered Coblentz as victors, Cologne being
already in their possession, and Mainz, or Mayence, the only city
in the possession of the allies on the left bank of the Rhine.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was informed by some French officers who were in the boat
with me, that the society in Coblentz was very elegant; that a
number of families lived in splendor; and also, that Bonaparte
had continued with some modifications the colleges, and most of
the public institutions, which the Electors of Treves had at various
times established in that city. The vast and celebrated monastery,
called in German Karthaus, or La Chartreuse, situated on a
high mountain, in the neighbourhood to the west of Coblentz,
from which the countries of Treves, Mayence, Cologne, Darmstadt,
d’Anspach, and Wied, may be seen, is converted into an
observatory, and a place of very agreeable recreation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon my return, in descending the Rhine, I had an opportunity
of more closely seeing Ehrenbreitstein, which I was enabled
to do from the following circumstance: the Rhine schuyt was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>uncommonly crowded, and late in the evening we arrived at a
hamlet on the right bank of the river to sleep: the house in which
we were to pass the night was not able to furnish beds more than
barely sufficient for the ladies on board, which at once determined
a French officer, one of the party, who had not placed his head upon
a pillow for three preceding nights, and who was a wretched invalid,
apparently in the last stage of a decline, to hunt amongst
the cottagers for a fiddler, to whose miserable sounds this epitome
of his nation, with several other officers and petty German merchants,
danced till the dawn of day, <i><span lang="fr">pour passer le temps</span></i>, and the
boat was ready to proceed. Having found by moon-light a nook
in a peasant’s nest, in the most romantic situation under heaven,
I lay down, and never awoke till an hour after the boat had departed,
in which dilemma I was obliged to hire a punt with two paddles, and
by the assistance of a couple of sturdy peasants overtook the passage-boat,
which lay off Coblentz, during which I visited Ehrenbreitstein.
At its base there is a pretty town and an excellent hotel; opposite
to the palace is a walk of limes, close to which was moored the
electoral state yacht, or barge, in shape and size resembling our
Lord Mayor’s, but not quite so gaudy. The ascent to this stupendous
rock, which is eight hundred feet in a perpendicular line
above the level of the river, is by a very narrow, steep, and winding
path: the noble fortification on its sides, and the castles, arsenals,
barracks, and batteries upon its summit, from whence
the eye can behold the mountains of Lorraine, the meanders of
the Rhine, and the countries through which it flows to a vast
distance, and from which the beholder might almost think he
could step into the clouds, are all roofless and dismantled. The
citadel was erected by the order of the Prince Bishop Herman
Hillinus, in the 12th century, upon the ruins of an ancient Roman
building.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the centre of the square, or parade upon the top, was formerly
mounted the celebrated cannon, called “the Griffon,” as
well known to the Germans as that called “Queen Anne’s pocket-piece”
is to the English. The former merits the national pride
which it has excited. It was cast at Francfort by the order of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Elector, Richard Greifenklau, weighed thirty thousand pounds,
and was capable of projecting a ball of one hundred and
eighty pounds, to a distance of sixteen miles. Close to the touch-hole
there was the following inscription: “Vogel Grief heis ich,
meinem gnädigen herrn von Trier dien ich, wo er mich heist
gewanten, da will ich Thoren und mauren Zerspalten. Simon gos
mich, 1528.” In English—“Griffon is my name, I serve my
gracious master of Treves, I shatter gates and walls, whenever
he commands me to exert my force. Simon cast me, 1528.”
This rock was supplied with water from a well 280 feet deep,
which occupied three years in digging, in the year 1481, and has
a subterranean communication with Coblentz, dug out of the solid
rock: the fortress was justly deemed, when properly garrisoned,
impregnable. In the time of the Swedish war, the attacks
of eighty thousand French troops on the southern side of it, and
of forty thousand on the northern, could make no impression
upon it; however, still maintaining its invulnerable character, it
was destined to bend to a foe, before which all local advantage is
useless, and all enterprise unavailing: after bravely sustaining a
blockade for a whole year, by the troops of the French republic,
the garrison having endured with the greatest fortitude almost
every description of privation and misery, were obliged to surrender
to <em>famine</em>, and capitulated on the 28th January, 1799; soon
after which the French covered this mighty rock with the ruins
of those wonderful fortifications, which had employed the skill of
the ablest engineer to complete, and which, but for the want of
food, would have defied the force of her assailing enemy to the
end of time. The thal, or valley below, is justly celebrated for its
fertility and romantic beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after our departure from Coblentz, we passed the island
of Obewerth; and a little further on, on our left, the disemboguement
of the river Lahn, which flows between two ancient and
picturesque towns, called the Upper and Lower Lahnsteins, where
the Rhine forms a considerable curve, and expands into the resemblance
of a placid lake, adorned with two vast mountains, one
crowned with a hoary watch tower, and the base of the other half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>encircled by a village, and the whole adorned by the captivating
combinations of forest scenery, rich meadows, and hanging vineyards
and orchards, amidst which, half embosomed in their foliage,
the peasant’s peaceful dwelling every now and then gladdened
the eye. This lovely view was soon exchanged for one of gloomy
magnificence; before we reached Boppart, we entered a melancholy
defile of barren and rugged rocks, rising perpendicularly
from the river to an immense height, and throwing a shade and
horror over the whole scene; here all was silent, and no traces of
man were to be found but in a few dispersed fishermen’s huts,
and crucifixes. Fear and superstition, “when the day has gone
down, and the stars are few,” have long filled every cave with
banditti, and every solitary recess with apparitions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of my passage I frequently, when the boat came
very near the land, sprung on shore with two or three other passengers,
and varied the scene by walking along the banks for a
mile or two, and during these excursions had frequently an opportunity
of admiring the astonishing activity and genius of the
French, who have, since they became masters of the left bank of
the Rhine, nearly finished one of the finest roads in the world,
extending from Mayence to Cologne, in the course of which they
have cut through many rocks impending over the river, and triumphed
over some of the most formidable obstacles Nature could
present to the achievement of so wonderful a design. This magnificent
undertaking, worthy of Rome in the most shining periods
of her history, was executed by the French troops, who, under
the direction of able engineers, preferred leaving these monuments
of indefatigable toil and elevated enterprize, to passing
their time, during the cessation of arms, in towns and barracks,
in a state of indolence and inutility.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sombre spires of Boppart, surrounded by its black wall
and towers, presented a melancholy appearance to the eye, relieved
by the rich foliage of the trees in its vicinity, and the mountains
behind it irregularly intersected with terraces covered with
vines to their very summits. The antiquity of this city is very
great; it was one of the fifty places of defence erected on the banks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>of the Rhine by Drusus Germanicus, and in the middle ages was
an imperial city.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not far from Boppart we saw, on the right bank of the river,
a procession of nuns and friars returning to a convent, the belfry
of which just peeped above a noble avenue of walnut-trees; they
were singing, and their voices increased the solemn effect of the
surrounding scenery. We put up for the night at a little village,
amid mountains half covered with vineyards, tufted with forests,
and chequered with convents and ruined castles. The evening
was stormy, and a full moon occasionally brightened the scene:
frequently we were enveloped in solemn gloom,</p>

<p class='c008'>I have before mentioned the excellent accommodations
which I have every where experienced at the different towns
we stopped at. Although at the last place where we slept
there were not above three or four houses, and we were not
expected, we had an excellent supper, and clean comfortable
beds. After our repast, as we were drinking some excellent
hock, many of the company present communicated the object
of their voyage, and amongst the rest an elegant young Frenchman,
about nineteen, who had charmed us all the way by his
politeness and inexhaustible flow of spirits, told us, to my no
little surprise, that the object of his excursion would not admit
of his returning when he pleased, for he was on his way to join
part of the French army at Maynz, or Mayence, as a conscript;
for which he had been drawn; and as his father who was a man of
fortune at Aix-la-Chapelle, but was very fond of his money, would
not put himself to the expense of paying the substitution money
for him, “<span lang="fr">par conséquence</span>,” said he with a smile of good humour,
“<span lang="fr">il me faut aller en personne</span>.” He told us that he had no
hopes of raising himself from the ranks but by good conduct and
equally good fortune, although his uncle was a general in the service,
and commanded that part of the army into which he was
soon to be incorporated. Whenever we stopped, he bestowed his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>money with liberality to beggars and chambermaids, alleging,
that as he was about to be a soldier, he ought to live, when he became
one, on a soldier’s pay, and that to have more till he was
promoted, would only make him uncomfortable; adding, that on
his arrival at head quarters, he should order a noble dinner, and
give his clothes to the waiters, and surrender himself up to the
captain of his company. He neither blamed the cruelty of his
father, the tyranny of the conscription, nor repined at his unlucky
fate, but filling a bumper, exclaimed, “<span lang="fr">Tout ce qu’il me
faut maintenant, c’est, de devenir bon soldat.</span>” “All that I have
to do is to make myself a good soldier.” I never saw a point more
easily and comfortably settled in my life. Our young conscript
had the best wishes of us all, for his happiness and speedy promotion.
This elastic spirit of vivacity seems to be the common property
of every Frenchman, and never did it appear more striking
than in the following circumstance: upon an English surgeon
some years since visiting a hospital at Paris, he saw in one of the
wards three Frenchmen who had received some very severe contusions
by the fall of a scaffold a few days before, lying in bed;
upon approaching them he found one dead, another dying, and
the one in the middle sitting upright in the bed, fiddling to several
invalids, who were dancing at the foot of it as well as they
were able.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a refreshing sleep we were called, upon the first intimation
of the day’s approach, and early in the morning arrived at
St. Goar, after passing by the ancient gothic tower of Welmich,
the white and venerable palace of Thurnburg, crowning the
mountain behind it, and through most delicious and romantic
scenery, every where profusely embellished with the hoary remains
of piety and war, under the various tints of progressive day.
In a minute after the boat had stopped, all the passengers disappeared
to attend matins, it being Sunday, and left me to gaze in
amazement upon the stupendous rock of Rheinfels, or the rock
of the Rhine, which rises most majestically behind the town, and
supports the remains of a vast fortress which bears its name, and
which the French demolished in the last war. This fortress was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>next in strength to that of Ehrenbreitstein; it was in the year
1245 converted from a convent to a fortress, by Count Diether le
Riche. In 1692 the Hessians, who were in possession of it, made
a gallant defence, headed by Colonel Goerz, against the French,
who were in superior force under the command of the celebrated
Mareschal de Tallard, who was compelled to give up the siege.
In the last war it experienced a different fate: the French troops
took quiet possession of it, and though it ranked next to Ehrenbreitstein
in strength and advantage, it partook not of the glory of
a similar resistance. At the foot of this enormous rock is a large
barrack lately built, but now deserted. There was also a flying
bridge here, but it has been removed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a bay of the river a little before we approached Oberwesel,
there is a vast rock, which the passengers on the river never fail
to address, for the purpose of hearing their own voices very closely
imitated by its echoes. Almost all the way from St. Goar to
Oberwesel, we were environed by enormous dark rocks covered
with shattered fragments, impending over and embrowning the
face of the river with their awful shadows. The gloom of the
scene was enlivened only by a few fishermen’s huts here and there
interspersed, protected from the intense heat of the sun retained
by and reflected from the rocks rising above them, by the foliage
of scanty groups of trees. This melancholy defile prepared us for
Oberwesel, a venerable city, filled with the solemnity of ancient
churches and deserted convents. In the time of the Emperor
Henry the Seventh, this city was an imperial one; afterwards, and
till the French seized it, it was in the possession of the Elector of
Treves. The church of the Minorites had once a fine copy of
Rubens’ Descent from the Cross, by a disciple of his, which upon
inquiry I found had been removed. Nothing can exceed the
beauty of the situation of this town; the scenery to the south of it
is luxuriant and romantic beyond imagination. Close to it, rising
from an avenue of stately walnut-trees, is a prodigious rock,
supporting the celebrated chateau de Schoenberg, which gave
birth to the illustrious and ancient family of the name of Belmont,
afterwards changed for the German name of Schoenberg or Beaumont:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>this place and the neighbourhood abound with slate quarries.
Immediately opposite, on the eastern bank, lofty mountains
clothed with hanging vineyards, and attended by the usual association
of mural ruins perched upon their pinnacles, and of monastic
buildings projecting from their sides, or rising from their
base, presented their majestic forms to the Rhine. From Oberwesel
we crossed over to Kaub, a fortified town a little way further
to the south. Previous to this we had kept, during the whole of
the passage, on the left bank. In crossing the river we passed
close to a large massy fortified tower, or fort, standing in the middle
of the Rhine upon a rock, called the Pfalz or Palatinate. In
distant times the Countesses of the Palatinate, when they were far
advanced in that state which</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>used to remove to this insulated spot of gloom for the purpose of
lying-in; afterwards it was used as a state prison, and a place to
watch the vessels ascending or descending the Rhine, to prevent
their eluding the tolls; it is now disused, but not likely very soon
to run to decay for want of inhabitants. Enthusiastically as I admire
the scenery of this part of the Rhine, I think I never saw a
place where man or woman would less prefer to be <em>confined</em> in,
than the Pfalz.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Kaub, a very ancient but neat town, which stands at the
base of a lofty mountain, in a handsome inn close to the river, we
tasted some delicious wine, the produce of the neighbouring vineyards,
for which we paid about ten pence English the bottle: and
we were regaled <em>gratuitously</em> with some of the finest grapes,
which a pretty girl produced as naturally as pipes and tobacco are
introduced in similar places in Holland. The vineyards of Oberwesel,
Kaub, and Bacharach, and the two hills of Vogtsberg and
Kühlberg near the last city, which abound with blue slate, produce
a vine remarkable for its odour and muscadelle flavour, and
form one of the distinguished vine divisions of this enchanting
region.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Upon leaving the Kaub we proceeded through a scene of transcendent
richness and beauty, where</p>

      <div class='line'>Palmy hilloc, and the flow’ry lap</div>

      <div class='line'>On either side umbrageous grots, and caves</div>
      <div class='line'>Of cool recess, on which the mantling vine</div>

      <div class='line in29'><cite>Milton’s Paradise Lost.</cite></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Our ears were delighted with the solemn choruses of the inhabitants
of the villages returning in large crowded boats from
their churches, and the bells of the convents, while the shores on
either side were enlivened by the peasants in their sabbath dresses
going to or returning from their respective places of worship. At
length the hoary battlements of <em>Bacharach</em> opened upon us; part
of this town slopes from the vine-clad mountain behind it, and the
remainder is close to the water. This town is also very ancient, and
as a proof of its antiquity, derives its name from <em>Bacchus</em>, to whom
tradition relates an altar was raised upon a rock in the centre of
the Rhine. Indeed we might have supposed that he had been worshipped
here in all the marvellous pomp ascribed to his original
adoration, and that his priestesses, by striking the earth with their
thyrsi, had caused rivers of milk, and honey, and wine to flow</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This insulated rock was admirably adapted for bearing upon
one of its trees, if ever one grew upon it, those little wooden or
earthen images of Bacchus, which from the smallness of their
mouths were called <em>Oscilla</em>, and were considered as so many watch
towers, from which the god might look after the vines, to prevent
their receiving injury. I know of no situation where he could
have performed his tutelar duties better than in this very spot.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>The vine here has been long celebrated for its excellence; the
Emperor Venceslas preferred four fuder of this wine (a fuder is
equal to three hundred and sixty gallons) to ten thousand florins
offered to him by the inhabitants of Nuremberg, to redeem their
sequestered privileges; and even Pope Pius the Second imported
for his table a fuder of this wine annually. These are illustrious
authorities in favour of the Bacharach wine, but the best is its
flavour.</p>

<p class='c007'>My laquais, a merry, good humoured fellow, and having no
bad ear for music withal, announced our being opposite to Lorch,
the first town where, in ascending the Rhine, the Rhingau commences,
in which district the finest wines are produced, by singing
a national song in honour of this vine-covered region, in which
every person on board joined most cordially. It was a very long
one, but the following stanzas will serve as a specimen of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fronting the august ruins of the castle of Sannek, the Rhine
presents the appearance of an ample lake, and the mountains,
which hitherto were numerous and lofty, recede as we approach
the pretty village of Drgeckshausen, a little beyond which the
river expands, and forms a noble curve near Asmanshausen, at
the foot of a forest, celebrated for the convent of Aulenhausen,
much frequented by devotees. Asmanshausen is known for the
fine blecker which it produces.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nearly opposite to Ruppertsberg the navigation of the Rhine
becomes very much impeded, and rendered hazardous by some
vast rocks which just raise their heads above the surface of the
water, and which our boatmen informed us had frequently occasioned
the loss of lives. Here the country again becomes rude and
rocky, occasionally covered with forest oak, and profusely ornamented
with dilapidated castles, where the steel-clad chieftains of
other times used to blow their</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>A visible change in the scenery to which we had been accustomed,
commenced as we approached Bingen: the hills retire
farther from the banks of the river, more modern towns, yet occasionally
chequered with the remains of antiquity, attract the
eye, the trees of the forest succeed to the vines of the mountain,
and in the room of stupendous rocks, rich meadows and corn-fields present their novel charms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bingen, which I visited upon my return, stands at the base
of a lofty mountain, on the summit of which the ancient castle of
Klopp is erected: the river Nohe disembogues itself by this city
into the Rhine, over which there is a handsome stone bridge, called
Druses, from its having the reputation of having been constructed
by Drusis Germanicus: this confluence of the two rivers
enables Bingen to carry on a considerable trade in Rhenish wines,
grain, and timber.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the shades of evening descended, we passed Ehrenfels, and
a little before nine arrived at Rüdesheim, where we supped at a
very handsome hotel, and drank copiously of its wine, which is
said to be superior to every other part of the Rhingau. Very early
in the morning I visited the remains of a magnificent castle, which
has the appearance of a Roman origin: this opinion is countenanced
by the strong evidences of the same character which attach
to the antiquities to be found in towns within the Rhingau. The
situation of this august ruin, which is close to the river, is commensurate
to its grandeur: the town of Rüdesheim is large, clean,
and cheerful, and has few of those features of awful gloom
which characterise several of the cities on the lower sides of this
river, which here widens to a great breadth, and is dotted over
with luxuriant little islands. Upon quitting this town we were
more frequently retarded than we had been before, by the obstructions
which terraces projecting into the river, and islands,
offered to our towing horse, who, with the driver, was frequently
belly deep in the water, which often forced our boatmen to the
tedious application of their poles. The towns of Geisenheim, St.
Bartholomaï, and Winkel, presented the same sprightly and
agreeable aspect as Rüdesheim. I have observed that many towns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>in the Rhingau are of Roman derivation, in corroboration of which,
many of their names are unquestionably so: as Winkel from
Vinicella; Eltivil, from Alta Villa; and Lorch, or as the Germans
pronounce it, Lorricke, from Laureacum, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>After quitting Rüdesheim, the noble priority of St. Johannesberg,
proudly placed upon the summit of a vast mountain, surrounded
with villages, hamlets, convents, nunneries, and other
stately buildings, and having a back ground of distant hills covered
with vines, commanded the admiration of all on board. This priory
was founded in 1102, by Ruthard, second archbishop of Mayence,
and in the devastating war of thirty years under Gustavus Adolphus,
was rased to the ground. The land was afterwards sold to
the abbot of Fuld, who rebuilt it in its present modern style, and
afterwards it was given to the late Prince of Orange as an indemnity,
and now forms a part of the rich territory of the Prince
of Nassau Usingen. In a cave or cellar belonging to the priory,
several thousands of hogsheads of the choicest wines are kept.
The red blecker of Johannesburg is celebrated all over the world,
and is the juice of the vineyard of the priory only; but the finest
produce of the Rhingau is from the grape of Asmanshausen; Ehrenfels,
and Rüdesheim, and particularly of some very small vineyards
contiguous to them, called Rodtland, Hauptberg, and Hinterhausen,
which rank the highest; and in this class also are included
the numerous vineyards on the steep hills of Bingen, on
the opposite shore. The second class embraces the vines of
Rothenberg, Geisenheim, and Kapellgarten. The third class includes
the grapes of Johannesberg, and the Fuldische Schlossberg.
The fourth, the vines of Hattenheim, and Marker Brunner.
The fifth, those of the cloister of Eberbach. Sixthly, those
of Kitterich and Grafenberg; and the seventh, those of Rauenthal,
and the hills and spots adjacent. All these classes are included in
the district of the Rhingau.</p>

<p class='c007'>The celebrated hock, is the produce of the vineyards of Hockheim,
or High-home, above Mayence, to the eastward. Of the
grape, that called the Reislinge, the longest known to these regions,
ranks the highest; the Orleans grape, the orange or red
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>Burgundy, and the Lambert, occupy the next place in the public
estimation; and the Muscadelle and Kleimberg, which are frequently
cultivated in private gardens, the third.</p>

<p class='c007'>We still continued our course on the left bank of the Rhine,
and passed by many beautiful villages, and the handsome towns
of Haltenheim, Erbach, Elfeld, Steinheimerhof, Nieder or Lower
Wallauf, where ancient churches and convents are interspersed
amongst many handsome modern houses. We reached Nieder
Wallauf, the last town of the Rhingau to the east, and afterwards
Schierstein, a pretty town where, as our progress was so frequently
delayed by the numerous islands which lie close to the bank,
in company with a very pleasant, intelligent German, I quitted
the boat, and walked to Biberich: the day was remarkably fine,
and our road lay through luxuriant corn and pasture fields, vineyards,
orchards, every where profusely adorned with castles, religious
houses, picturesque cottages, and beautiful chateaus, behind
which the vast forest of Landeswald extends to an immense
distance: at length the numerous spires, and the lofty towers and
palaces of Mayence opened upon us, from the opposite side of
the river, and had a very venerable, and majestic effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our entrance into an avenue of nearly a mile and a half in
length, thickly lined with walnut, apple, pear, and plum trees,
loaded with fruit, announced our approach to Biberich, the superb
palace of the Prince of Nassau Usingen. As I made a drawing of
this palace and the adjacent town when I descended the Rhine,
and the boat was in a central part of the river, it will be unnecessary
to describe it. I had no time to view the apartments, but
my laquais informed me, that they were grand, and furnished in
a princely manner: the town is modern, small, and very handsome.
As we skirted Ingelheim, we were informed that the illustrious
Charlemagne, the great prototype of Bonaparte, selected
this place for his favourite residence, where he built a magnificent
palace, which was supported by a hundred columns of Italian
marble, and had an immense number of apartments, in which
synods and the most important councils of state were held: that
his son Louis le Debonnaire died broken-hearted here, in consequence
of the rebellions of his sons Lotharius and Louis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not a vestige remains of this celebrated pile to prove that it
once existed: but in the life of Louis le Debonnaire, Nigellus
thus consecrates this building:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span><span lang="la">Est locus ille situs rapidi prope flumina Rheni,</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>No doubt is entertained that that august pile once embellished
this spot. Charlemagne could not have chosen a place more advantageous
with regard to his political relations, or more beautiful
in richness and variety of scenery, where Nature every where
saluted him with wine, with fruit, and every desirable production
of a genial soil, fit to make glad the soul of an emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>In less than an hour after quitting Ingelheim we reached Cassel,
immediately opposite Mayence, to which it communicates by an
amazing long bridge, formed of a moveable platform, placed upon
fifty-six lighters, two or three of which draw out at pleasure by
means of ropes and pullies, to open a passage for vessels ascending
or descending the Rhine, and is 3830 feet long; one very
similar to this was built by order of Charlemagne at the same
place: here our voyage terminated. On account of the search of
the custom-house officers being very severe on the French side,
the passengers prefer being landed at Cassel: where all the bustle
of a populous city, and a great military station, presented itself.
The bridge was crowded with beautiful and elegantly dressed
women, French officers, soldiers, and various other persons, in
carriages and on foot, going to or returning from Mayence, which,
with its venerable cathedral and splendid buildings, extending
themselves along the river, had a very grand effect. Our luggage
was searched by a German custom-house officer, who behaved
very politely; and I proceeded to a good hotel in Cassel, and sat
down with several French officers to some excellent refreshments.</p>

<p class='c007'>In my description of the Rhine as I ascended it, I have, from
the desire of not fatiguing my reader, only noticed the principal
towns and objects, some of which I visited then, and others on
my return. I felt myself abundantly rewarded by the unparalleled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>beauty and grandeur of those scenes, which so often excited my
admiration and amazement, for any little inconvenience, and perhaps
some little hazard, to which I was occasionally exposed, and
I regret that I can only convey a very imperfect impression of
them to those who have never had the good fortune to form their
personal opinion of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having been previously warned not to attempt to enter Mayence,
which, as it is now incorporated with France, I shall call by
that name, on account of the unusual rigour exercised by the
police towards strangers, in consequence of the city being the
great military depot of the French on the Rhine, and the greatest
skill of their engineers having been lavished on its fortifications,
I was content to view it from Cassel, and to receive some
little account of it from a very intelligent German, who had resided
there some years, as we looked upon the city from our
hotel window. The electoral palace, of red brick, by the side of
which the Rhine flows, where Bonaparte resided during his stay
in Mayence, in 1804, presented a very noble appearance. The
dome or cathedral, which rose with awful dignity before us,
is a vast gothic pile, having four unequal towers: it had once a
lofty spire, but a thunder-storm, many years since, beat it down
with lightning, and burnt a considerable part of the edifice. Few
cities have suffered more than this by the ravages of war; most of
its civil and sacred buildings have been at one period or another
damaged or destroyed by cannon, the ruins of which still remain.
My intelligent friend informed me that this city was celebrated
for the great beauty of its female inhabitants, and that before the
French took possession of it the electoral court threw a brilliant
lustre over the place, which was unrivalled by any city on the
Rhine for its gaiety, elegance, and splendor; characteristics which
have been impaired, but far from annihilated. It contains colleges,
lyceums, a theatre, and ball and concert rooms, all of which continue
to be well attended.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mayence, from its having been always considered as one of
the great bulwarks of Germany, suffered most dreadfully in the
last war. In October, 1792, General Custine compelled it to surrender
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>after a slight bombardment, and under his administration
the majority of the inhabitants who did not fly entered cordially
into the views of the French revolutionists: he augmented the fortifications
of the city, and placed a strong garrison in the suburbs
of Cassel, which has always been considered as a place of great
importance, and raised a number of redoubts and batteries there.
In July, 1793, the Prussians, after seizing on Costheim, and defeating
an army under General Houchard, which was marching
to succour the garrison of Mayence, reduced both that city and
Cassel, the miserable inhabitants of which endured the greatest
horrors, and many of the finest and most venerable buildings of
the former were fired, and nearly destroyed, during the siege.
Merlin, who acted as one of the commissioners to the French
army during the siege, stated to the convention, that such was
the scarcity of provisions, <em>a pound of horse-flesh had been sold at
two, and a dead cat at six livres</em>, and that five thousand men had
perished in defence of the place. Although Custine had no choice
left but to capitulate, Barrere, by his report of the siege, led to
his being denounced and decapitated. During this siege the palace
of the provosts suffered terribly; the celebrated electoral
palace called La Favorite, and seven churches, were totally destroyed;
and scarce a house escaped without being pierced with
cannon balls. Mutton sold for sixty sols a pound, and beef one
hundred sols; and at last bell-metal and paper money were used:
the following was the superscription of the latter:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">“Mar. 1793—2de. de la Rep. Fran.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And, what an epicure will perhaps more regret, the whole vineyard
of Hockheim was destroyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The French were highly indignant at the loss of so important
a place, and resolved upon attempting the recovery of it from its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>victors, as soon as the mighty objects which claimed on all sides
the activity and energy of their rulers and generals, were accomplished;
and accordingly, in June 1795, the French army again
blockaded this devoted city, during which it sustained a renewal
of its suffering, from which it again was relieved by the successful
operations of Mareschal Clairfayt, at the head of the Austrians
against the revolutionary troops, who were attacked and routed
upon the heights of Mornbach, when the Mareschal appeared before
Mayence, attacked and carried the entrenched camp of the
enemy, upon which the skill of their ablest engineers had been
exerted for eleven months to render it invulnerable. General
Schaal, who occupied this strong position, on the retreat of Jourdan,
with fifty-two battalions of infantry and five regiments of
cavalry, was obliged to retire with great loss in cannon, ammunition
and men. In this bombardment some Tyrol sharp-shooters
displayed their wonted skill in an amazing manner, by killing,
from the banks of Cassel, several French officers with their rifle-pieces,
who were walking on the ramparts on the opposite side of
the river, the breadth of which I have already ascertained by the
length of the floating bridge. In the beginning of the year 1797
a better destiny smiled upon the French arms in this region, and
Moreau and Hoche made both sides of the Rhine resound with
their victories, when the troops which garrisoned Mayence, to
prevent the entire and unavailing demolition of the city, relinquished
its possession, and the French remained masters of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Volumes have been written upon the superior pretension of
Mayence to the original invention of the art of printing, and to
transfer the honours of the discovery from Lawrence Coster of
Haarlem to John Guttenburg, a citizen of this place. A vast deal
of special pleading has been displayed on both sides; and, to use a
jockey phrase, these racers for the merited gratitude and admiration
of all who followed them, reached the goal almost “neck
and neck,” but the majority of judgments given appropriate the
glory to Coster: his mode was the simplest, and therefore thought
to be the earliest; his moulds were made of wood and immoveable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>and he stamped the paper only on one side: Guttenburg printed
on both sides of the leaf with moveable metal types.</p>

<p class='c007'>The extremity of the bridge towards Cassel, and all the ramparts
and redoubts of the town, which are very strongly fortified,
were occupied by French soldiers. With two German gentlemen
and a Dutch officer, I set off for Francfort, distant eight stunder or
hours, or four German miles, under a scorching sun, which did
not seem to have any effect upon a large party of monks and
priests, and followers, bearing the host, who were walking bare
headed in procession to a monastery which we had just passed,
near which I left the carriage to make a sketch of Mayence, upon a
projecting bank of the river Maine, where I bade adieu to the Rhine.
Our road lay through an avenue of walnut, apple, and pear trees,
loaded with fruit, to which passengers helped themselves whenever
inclination disposed them to do so; and part of the Hockheim
hills, covered with the renowned vineyards, which produce what
in England is called old hock. As many a saint, high in superstitious
veneration, must have had at least ten skulls and one hundred
toe nails, as if no illusion has been practised by those who
have exhibited them to the credulous in different eras and various
regions, so nothing short of the power of transmuting water into
wine, could produce from these vineyards the immense quantity
of wine which passes under the title of hock. Certain it is, that
the greater quantity of wine honoured with that name, is from
the grapes of both sides of the lower part of the Rhine. In the district
where it is produced, very old genuine Hockheim wine is
sold at the rate of three, and sometimes five, shillings a bottle.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the first stage we stopped at a village where there is a noble
building upon an eminence, commanding a beautiful prospect,
which I at first took for a palace, but it proved to be a tobacco
manufactory, warehouses, and the residence of the proprietor and
his family; the front is five hundred feet long, and the whole
exterior infinitely more princely than Buckingham-house. After
passing this place the road became level, and the country presented
corn-fields, pasture, and orchards in great abundance. For
many miles round, this country had been often the theatre of hostilities;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>and though Nature had long since effaced their melancholy
impressions from her fields by reviving verdure, yet prostrate
cottages and battered convents displayed the march and
ravages of the demon War! Happy, thrice happy my own country,
where the sound of cannon is never heard but to announce a
victory, or to augment the gaiety of some festive occasion!</p>

<p class='c007'>The suburbs of Francfort are very delightful, and after passing
over a draw-bridge, and through a deep, gateway, we entered
the city, the streets of which are crowded and full of gaiety
and bustle, in consequence of the great autumnal fair which was
holding there. All the best inns were brimful, and with great
difficulty the Dutch officer and myself procured a miserable double-bedded
room, at an inferior inn, filled with petty merchants and
their families, whom the spirit of traffic had led to this celebrated
mart, and was half choked up with cases and boxes containing their
merchandize. This town swarms with French soldiers, about thirty
of whom slept in rooms adjoining to ours, where they deported
themselves with great order. My companion had just returned
from the Cape, in consequence of its surrender to the British
arms. He spoke with liberal rapture of gallantry of the English
troops. In Germany, as in Holland, time is taken by the forelock,
and at six o’clock the stiefelputzer, or boot-cleaner, knocked
at the door, followed by the chambermaid with a composition of
frankincense and other gums of a pyramidal shape, and about an
inch high, much used in Germany, called a Räucher-kerz, for perfuming
rooms, which she placed upon our candlestick and left
smoking. My Dutch companion annoyed me at this hour, first by
begging that I would hear him read one book of Milton’s Paradise
Lost, a little English edition of which he had in his pocket,
which he achieved in an incongruous mêlange of various languages;
and secondly, by begging me to lend him my tooth-brush
for a few minutes, observing, that he preferred an English tooth-brush
to any other, and at the same moment applying it to his
teeth with equal alacrity and gratification. After he had paid such
a compliment to English tooth-brushes, and had done me the
honour of using mine, the least I could do was to beg that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>would favour me with keeping it for my sake, with which he was
much pleased, and accordingly introduced it to a party of combs
and razors in his shaving-case. In all other respects he was an
agreeable man, and I am sure a liberal-minded soldier. This city,
which was till lately imperial, is one of the most ancient towns in
Germany, and has several handsome streets and noble buildings:
it is particularly celebrated for the splendor of its hotels, which
are reported to be the most magnificent in Europe, particularly
those called the Rothen Haus or Red House, and the Rörniskchen
Kaiser or Roman emperor, where the King of Prussia lodged
when he visited this town; and the Darmstadter Hof, in which
Mareschal Augerau and his suite resided whilst I was at Francfort:
so crowded was the city, that it was with great difficulty and some
interest I procured apartments at the Weiden-hof, or Willow-Court,
a second rate inn, but of great magnitude. Our table d’hote,
at which between two and three hundred persons of respectability
sat down every day, was held in a noble room; it was splendidly
served, and an excellent band seated in an elevated gallery, performed
during dinner. The principal houses are built of red and
white stone: the cassino, to which I was admitted by a card of
introduction from one of the principal bankers, is very elegant.
There are also several other clubs and assembly rooms. The
theatre is spacious and very handsome, the performers were good,
and the band is large and select. Opposite to the theatre is a
mall, formed by several rows of trees, which in the evening is
much frequented, where many a lover may exclaim with Moore,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Oh, Rosa! say “good night” once more,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I’ll repeat it o’er and o’er,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till the first glance of dawning light</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall find us saying still “good night.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Before the Rhenish confederation the town was split into two
religious sects, the Lutherans and Calvinists, which are now
blended in perfect harmony by the liberal influence of toleration.
A grand discharge of cannon one morning announced the ceremony
of the members of the senate and the colleges being about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>to assemble in the Römer, or town-hall, to complete the investing
the Prince Primate with the sovereignty of the city, the keys having
been delivered up before to the representative of the prince,
under a similar discharge of artillery, agreeable to certain provisions
contained in the act of the Rhenish confederation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Curiosity induced me to visit the place of this meeting, which
is a very large and ancient gothic pile, situated in a narrow street.
In this building are several chambers, which have been applied to
memorable purposes; one in particular, which before the late revolution
in the German empire, was used by the Electors upon
the august occasion of making choice of a new Emperor: there
are some good paintings in some of these apartments. The ceremony
of the installation of the Prince Primate was over in a very
short time; the mob, which was a small one, soon dispersed; and
scarcely any one mentioned the matter three days afterwards.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cathedral church of St. Bartholomew, which belongs to
the catholics, is another venerable relic of antiquity: it is reported
to have been built by Pepin, king of France, in 756, enriched
by Charlemagne, and plundered by Lewis of Bavaria, on account
of its chapter adhering to the Pope. Strange to relate, although
the coronation of the Emperor used to take place in it, there is
not one object within its walls, either of sacred splendor, or monumental
celebrity, worthy of notice. In the year 1792, when the
French entered this city as conquerors, their commanding officers
went with great military pomp to this cathedral; where, being attended
by the senators, the commander in chief closed an address
by exclaiming, “Under the roof of this venerable temple have
not many of you witnessed the coronation of the Emperor of the
Romans?” to which no answer was given. “I demand a reply to
my question,” exclaimed the general with some warmth; “Yes”
was faintly answered; “Then,” replied he, “you will never see
him more in this place.” This prophecy issued from an oracle
which possessed the means of consummating its prediction.</p>

<p class='c007'>I was pleased with the fair, although it fell far short of my expectation;
the principal booths which were erected near the Römer,
and also parallel with the river Maine, formed a very agreeable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>and sprightly street, entirely covered with canvass awnings:
here all sorts of goods, the productions of various parts of the
globe, were exposed to sale; and here were also several booksellers’
stalls, where the most eminent works are sold folded in
sheets, for the purchase of lesser merchants in the trade. No press
in the world is so prolific as the German: the number of ingenious
works which it annually yields, amongst which are many able
productions, are astonishing. I was informed that the fair had
wasted almost to nothing, in consequence of the various injuries
it has sustained from the war, and the severe policy of Bonaparte
respecting the introduction of English manufacture, very little of
which was to be found at this mart. In the printers’ stalls, which
used to be well supplied from the English school of engraving,
were very few prints worthy of attention. I saw several execrable
imitations of some from the exquisite pencil of Westall. At the
end of the principal street of the fair, close to the river, were rows
of immense tubs, in which, like Diogenes, many poor German
tradesmen and their families very sagaciously eat and slept, for
want of a better habitation.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>An excursion to the beautiful and elegant little sovereign
town of Offenbach, about five English miles from Francfort,
enabled me to admire the great progress which the Germans
have made in the tasteful art of carriage-building. In a very large
depot of carriages there, I saw several which would have been
distinguished for their lightness and beauty in London. There
are several other fabrics, viz. of jewellery, pocket-books, tobacco,
toys, &#38;c. The society of this place, where the prince who bears
its name has a little court, is very refined and accomplished. The
suburbs of Francfort are formed of beautiful and romantic walks
and vineyards, enlivened by handsome country-houses. On the
road near the entrance to the west, adjoining the splendid chateau
of Mr. Beatham, the celebrated banker, at whose town house the
present King of Prussia became enamoured with his Queen, is a
monument, composed of a helmet, a lion’s skin, and emblems of
war, in bronze, made out of the cannon taken by the King of
Prussia from the French at Mayence, mounted upon a stone pedestal,
rising from an artificial rock, upon which are inscriptions
commemorative of its having been raised by Prince Williamstadt
to the memory of the gallant Prince of Hesse-Phillipsthal and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>three hundred brave Hessians, who perished on this spot, when
the French were obliged to evacuate the town in the year 1792.
The French had taken quiet possession of it a few months before,
under the command of General Neuwinger and Colonel Houchard,
when they levied two millions of florins upon pain of military
execution on the opulent classes of the inhabitants. The most
distinguished personage in Francfort was Mareschal Augerau,
whom I frequently met. The heroic valour and skill which he
displayed in the campaigns of Italy, particularly at the battle of
Arcole and before Mantua, and afterwards in Germany, will render
his name illustrious in the military annals of France: he is a
highly polished and accomplished gentleman, and was equally
admired and esteemed by the inhabitants of Francfort; he lived
in a style becoming his dignity, without ostentation, and was upon
all occasions very accessible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Linglebach, the celebrated painter, was born here in 1625.
His subjects were fairs, mountebanks, sea prospects, naval engagements,
and landscapes, in which he eminently excelled. In
company with my two friends from whom I parted at Rotterdam,
and who rejoined me here, I set off for Darmstadt, about eighteen
English miles from Francfort. We crossed a noble bridge over
the Maine, and passed through a considerable, and fortified town,
called Saxenhausen. Our road, which was sandy, was for a considerable
way lined with luxuriant nursery-grounds and vineyards.
About four miles from Francfort we passed a plain oaken post,
about six feet high, upon which, under a painted star and crown,
was written (in German), “Sovereign Territory of the Prince
Primate of the Rhenish confederation.” Upon this road I saw,
for the first time, a great number of little posts, painted white and
numbered; they are called minute-posts, by which the pedestrian
traveller is enabled to ascertain with great exactness the progress
he makes in his journey. A very handsome avenue of stately poplars,
of nearly two English miles, forms the approach to the city,
which is nearly surrounded by a lofty wall, not capable of affording
much protection against an enemy. The suburbs contain some
handsome houses, in which, as the principal hotel in the city was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>full, we took up our quarters at the post-house, a very excellent
inn.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a capital, Darmstadt is small, and its palace infinitely too
large: of the latter the Emperor Joseph sarcastically observed,
that it was big enough to accommodate himself and the nine electors.
However, very little of the internal part is finished, and most
of the windows are boarded up. The Grand Duke and his family
reside in a part of a new palace, projecting from the old one, looking
towards the gardens. That immense structure is built in imitation
of the Thuilleries, and surrounded by a broad deep dry
ditch. The hereditary Prince, who married the youngest daughter
of the House of Baden, and whose sisters share the thrones of
Russia and Sweden, has a large and handsome house at a little
distance from the old palace; exclusive of this prince, his Royal
Highness the Grand Duke, Louis the Tenth, has several other
children. He is turned of fifty years of age, is an enlightened,
brave, and amiable prince, and a celebrated engineer. He was
the last of the German princes who in the last war sheathed
the sword he had drawn against the French; a power which the
preservation of his dignity and his dominion compelled him to
coalesce with. Bonaparte, when he was digesting the Rhenish
Confederation, wished to invest him with the kingly dignity, but
the Grand Duke declined the offer. Darmstadt has produced many
valiant and distinguished officers. At the parade I had the pleasure
of seeing General Von Werner, the governor of the city,
who at the head of the chevaux legers, or light horse, performed
prodigies of valour in the Netherlands in the last war, where in
one battle he was surrounded by seven French chasseurs, from
whom he received the most desperate wounds in various parts of
his body before he surrendered. The late General Von Düring,
a name, on account of the heroic courage of the person to whom
it belonged, for ever embalmed in the memory of the English
who served in the last war in the Low Countries, in the years
1793, 4, 5, was born in this dutchy. The troops were good looking
men, and presented a very soldier-like appearance: the uniform
of the officers of the infantry is a blue coat faced with scarlet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>a large cocked hat, richly trimmed with deep silver lace, and
has a very handsome appearance. The dragoons wear a casket, a
light green jacket, and are well mounted. The pay of a soldier is
about the value of twopence a day. Several captains in the army
are princes (princes appanages), or princes of a distant branch,
who have but little property.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal object to attract the attention of a traveller is
the Exercierhaus, or house for manœuvering the troops in the
winter: it forms one side of the space of ground allotted for the
parade, is three hundred and fourteen feet long, and one hundred
and fifty-two broad, and has been erected about thirty-five years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ceiling of this enormous room is self-supported by a vast
and most ingenious wooden frame-work, without the assistance of
either pillar or arch below. Above this ceiling are a great number
of apartments. In a part of the room below, the artillery of the
Grand Duke is deposited, which is kept in high military order.
About four thousand troops can be manœuvred in this room with
ease. The gardens adjoining to the exercise-house are laid out
in the English style, are very spacious, and would be very beautiful
if the ground undulated a little more; much taste has been
displayed in their arrangement, and the house of the chief gardener
is very pretty. These gardens are liberally opened to the
public, form the principal promenade, and were embellished on
the day I visited them with several lovely and elegantly dressed
women. In one part is a neat but simple mausoleum, erected by
the order of Frederic the Great to the memory of one of the landgravines
of Darmstadt, a princess remarkable for the powers of
her mind and the beauty of her person: upon which is the following
elegant inscription, composed by that great Prince:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la">Hic jacet Ludovica Henricæ, Landgrafia Hessiæ,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">“sexu fœmina, ingenio vir.</span>”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Here lies Louisa Henrietta, Landgravine of Hesse,</div>
      <div class='line'>“a woman in form, in mind a man.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>A short distance from the garden is a park in which wild boars
are kept for hunting. The religion of the dutchy is Lutheran. The
affairs of the state are conducted by a court of regency, and other
courts, composed of counsellors and a president, who regulate the
military, administer the laws, digest the finance, and superintend
all matters that relate to religion. Those who complain of “the
law’s delay” in England, would be speedily reconciled to the tardity
of its progress were they to commence a suit in Germany,
where it excited considerable surprise that the procrastination of
Mr. Hastings’ trial, which lasted <em>seven years</em> and <em>three months</em>,
should have caused any murmurs amongst us, that period being
thought a moderate one by almost every German. Living in this
dutchy is very cheap: a bachelor can keep a horse, dine at the first
table d’hôte, and drink a bottle of wine a day, and mingle in the
best circles, upon one hundred pounds per annum. The society
in Darmstadt is very agreeable. As the minds of the men and
women are so highly cultivated and accomplished in Germany,
every party presents some mode or other, equally delightful and
blameless, to make Time smile, and to strew over his passage with
flowers. The country round Darmstadt is very beautiful, and
abounds with corn and various sorts of fruit-trees, which are frequently
unprotected by any fence, and the common path winds
through avenues of them. Amongst other delicious fruit, there
is a red plumb called zwetschen, peculiar to the south of Germany,
which grows in great richness and luxuriance in this
dutchy. As a proof of the profusion in which it grows, in one of
my rambles with some friends, I met a boy laden with a basket
full of them, who sold us 130 for some little pieces, amounting
to a penny English; and the little rogue looked back with an arch
smile as we separated, as if he had made a highly profitable bargain.
As I was walking in the principal street with a friend of
mine, I was struck with the following expression: “Look at that
officer; would you believe it that with so fine a person, and a
mind to correspond with it, he has received <em>two baskets</em>?” My
surprise at the expression was dissolved by being informed, that
when a lady refuses an offer of love, she sends the luckless lover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>a little basket as a token of her disinclination to receive his addresses.</p>

<p class='c007'>The French interest is powerful in Darmstadt, although
amongst all the princes of the Rhenish confederation, no one has
displayed more energy and spirit than the Grand Duke. A striking
instance of this occurred to one of my companions: in this
dutchy, and I believe in other parts of Germany, there is a law
that renders it penal to drive off the road upon the grass, but the
postillion who drove him, having, to spare his horses, offended
against the law, archly turned round to him and said, “Pray, Sir,
in case I should be prosecuted, say you are a Frenchman, and
then they will not make me pay the penalty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The antipathy between the natives of Darmstadt and their
neighbours of Hesse Cassel, is as inveterate as that between the
English and French. As I was preparing to set off for Heidelburg,
we heard that the troops of Darmstadt were expected to
march at a moment’s notice to seize upon Hanau, a town belonging
to Hesse Cassel, which has afforded frequent subject of broil
between the two countries; but upon inquiry, we were privately
informed, that Bonaparte was expected to call upon the Grand
Duke to march his contingent to the field of battle against the
Prussians, with whom immediate hostilities were thought to be
inevitable. I much regretted that this approaching storm, which
began to spread a deep shade over the political horizon, prevented
me from extending my excursion further into Germany, a country
to which Nature has been very bountiful, where the women
unite refined accomplishments to the charms of person, and where
the men are distinguished for their genius, probity, and indefatigable
industry, and both for an unaffected urbanity of manners.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon my return to Francfort, part of the French army rushed
in like a torrent, on its way to give the Prussians battle. It had
rained very hard all the day on which the advance guard entered;
but every soldier, although covered with mud, and wet to the skin,
went, or rather danced, singing merrily all the way, to the house
where he was to be quartered. This city has been dreadfully
drained at various times, by the immense number of French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>troops which have been billeted upon the inhabitants: at one
time they had fifty thousand to support, and to supply with various
articles of clothing for six months. Every house had a certain
number billeted upon them, according to its size and the opulence
of the family. Upon their march the French are as little
encumbered as possible; in their way they compel the farmer,
butcher, baker, &#38;c. to furnish them with what they want, for
which notes are given by the proper officers, if they have no cash,
to the seller, according to the price agreed upon, which is generally
a very fair one, and which the paymaster in the rear of the
army discharges upon coming up.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the gathering tempest prevented me from penetrating into
the south of Germany beyond Darmstadt, I applied to M. Bacher,
the French minister, for permission to return <i><span lang="fr">pour changer</span></i> to Rotterdam,
by the way of Brussels, Antwerp, &#38;c. but the old, shrewd
politician, in a very crabbed manner refused, and ordered me to
keep on the right bank of the Rhine. Thus was I obliged to retrace
my steps; however, it enabled me again to contemplate the
sublime and beautiful scenes of the Rhine, which I did in a boat,
the cabin and roof of which were crammed with passengers to
various cities on different sides of the river: the wind was against
us, but the stream was strong, of which our boatmen availed themselves
by placing the vessel transversely, and, without rowing or
towing, in two days and a half we bade adieu to our voyageurs, a
little before we reached Cologne, where we landed at Duitz, and
retrod our steps, which enabled me here and there to correct
errors and supply omissions. At Wesel we arrived at half past
six o’clock in the evening, and found the gates shut, which compelled
us to sleep upon straw at a little inn in the suburbs. At six
the next morning, we beheld a sad massacre perpetrating by the
engineers and soldiers of the garrison, upon all the trees in the
neighbourhood that could conceal or assist an enemy in approaching
the town, and for a similar reason several houses in the suburbs
were marked for destruction. Such is the commencement of the
horrors of war! The Prussians were expected to lay siege to this
strongly fortified town in a few days, which induced the Grand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Duke of Berg, who was in the citadel at the time, to have recourse
to these severe preparations.</p>

<p class='c007'>After pursuing our route through Amsterdam, where the
great fair was holding, during which the Dutch character became
absolutely lively, through Leyden and Rotterdam, at the last of
which we were sadly annoyed about our necessary passports of
departure, which require the signature of the King’s secretary at
the Hague, and the countersign of a Dutch commissioner, appointed,
during my absence, for such purpose at Rotterdam, in
consequence of the French ambassador’s power over such matters
having been withdrawn, we at length, like hunted hares, arrived
at the spot from whence we started, viz. Maesland-sluys, where,
after undergoing the vexation of more forms and ceremonies before
our old friend the commodore, on board of his guard-ship,
we embarked in the identical dismal galliot which brought us to
Holland, and after expecting every moment an order of embargo,
we got out to sea, where we endured no common misery for six
days and nights, after which I landed again upon my beloved native
country:</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
